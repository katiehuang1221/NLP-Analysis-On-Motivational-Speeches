president beilock barnard faculty trustees and honorees katherine johnson anna quindlen and rhea suh and to each of the  badass women of the barnard graduating class of  congratulations doesnt it feel like the second you figure anything out in life it ends and youre forced to start all over again experts call these times of lifetransitions i call them terrifying i went through a terrifying transition recently when i retired from soccer the world tries to distract us from our fear during these transitions by creating fancy ceremonies for us this graduation is your fancy ceremony mine was the espys a nationally televised sports award show i had to get dressed up for that just like you got dressed up for thisbut they sent me a really expensive fancy stylistit doesnt look like you all got one sorry about that so it went like this espn called and told me they were going to honor me with their inaugural icon award i was humbled of course to be regarded as an icon did i mention that im an icon i received my award along with two other incredible athletes basketballs kobe bryant and footballs peyton manning we all stood on stage together and watched highlights of our careers with the cameras rolling and the fans cheering—and i looked around and had a moment of awe i felt so grateful to be there—included in the company of kobe and peyton i had a momentary feeling of having arrived like we women had finally made it then the applause ended and it was time for the three of us to exit stage left and as i watched those men walk off the stage it dawned on me that the three of us were stepping away into very different futures each of us kobe peyton and i—we made the same sacrifices we shed the same amount of blood sweat and tears wed left it all on the field for decades with the same ferocity talent and commitment—but our retirements wouldnt be the same at all because kobe and peyton walked away from their careers with something i didnt have enormous bank accounts because of that they had something else i didnt have freedom their hustling days were over mine were just beginning later that night back in my hotel room i laid in bed and thought this isnt just about me and this isnt just about soccer we talk a lot about the pay gap we talk about how we us women overall still earn only  cents on the dollar compared to men and black women make only  cents while latinas make  cents what we need to talk about more is the aggregate and compounding effects of the pay gap on womens lives over time the pay gap means women are able to invest less and save less so they have to work longer when we talk about what the pay gap costs us letsbe clear it costs us our very lives and it hit me that id spent most of my time during my career the same way id spent my time on that espys stage just feeling grateful grateful to be one of the only women to have a seat at the table i was so grateful to receive any respect at all for myself that i often missed opportunities to demand equality for all of us but as you know women of barnard—change is here women have learned that we can be grateful for what we have while also demanding what we deserve like all little girls i was taught to be grateful i was taught to keep my head down stay on the path and get my job done i was freaking little red riding hood you know the fairy tale its just one iteration of the warning stories girls are told the world over little red riding hood heads off through the woods and is given strict instructions stay on the path dont talk to anybody keep your head down hidden underneath your handmaids tale cape and she does at first but then she dares to get a little curious and she ventures off the path thats of course when she encounters the big bad wolf and all hell breaks loose the message is clear dont be curious dont make trouble dont say too much or bad things will happen i stayed on the path out of fear not of being eaten by a wolf but of being cut being benched losing my paycheck if i could go back and tell my younger self one thing it would be this abby you were never little red riding hoodyou were alwaysthe wolf so when i was entrusted with the honor of speaking here today idecided that the most important thing for me to say to you is this barnard women—class of —we are the wolves in  around the year of your birth wolves were reintroduced into yellowstone national park after being absent for seventy years in those years the number of deer had skyrocketed because they were unchallenged alone at the top of the food chain they grazed away and reduced the vegetation so much that the river banks were eroding once the wolves arrived they thinned out the deer through hunting but more significantly their presence changed the behavior of the deer wisely the deer started avoiding the valleys and the vegetation in those places regenerated trees quintupled in just six years birds and beavers started moving in the river dams the beavers built provided habitats for otters and ducks and fish the animal ecosystem regenerated but that wasnt all the rivers actually changed as well the plant regeneration stabilized the river banks so they stopped collapsing the rivers steadied—all because of the wolves presence see what happened here the wolves who were feared as a threat to the systemturned out to be its salvation barnard women are you picking up what im laying down here women are feared as a threat to our system—and we will also be our societys salvation our landscape is overrun with archaic ways of thinking about women about people of color about the other about the rich and the poor about the the powerful and the powerless—and these ways of thinking are destroying us we are the ones weve been waiting for we will not little red riding hood our way through life we will unite our pack storm the valley together and change the whole bloody system throughout my life my pack has been my team teams need a unifying structure and the best way to create one collective heartbeat is to establish rules for your team to live by it doesnt matter what specific page youre all on just as long as youre all on the same one here are four rules ive used to unite my pack and lead them to gold rule one make failure your fuel heres something the best athletes understandbut seems like a hard concept for nonathletes to grasp nonathletes dont know what to do with the gift of failure so they hide it pretend it never happened reject it outright—and they end up wasting it listen failure is not something to be ashamed of its something to be powered by failure is the highest octane fuel your life can run on you gotta learn to make failure your fuel when i was on the youth national team only dreaming of playing alongside mia hamm you know her good i had the opportunity to visit the national teams locker room the thing that struck me most wasnt my heroes grassstained cleats or their names and numbers hanging above their lockers—it was a picture it was a picture that someone had taped next to the door so that it would be the last thing every player saw before she headed out to the training pitch you might guess it was a picture of their last big win of them standing on a podium accepting gold medals—but it wasnt it was a picture of their longtime rival—the norwegian national team—celebrating after having just beaten the usa in the  world cup in that locker room i learned that in order to become my very best—on the pitch and off—id need to spend my life letting the feelings and lessons of failure transform into my power failure is fuel fuel is power womenlisten to me we must embrace failure as our fuel instead of accepting it as our destruction as michelle obama recently said i wish that girls could fail as well as men do and be okay because let me tell you watching men fail up—its frustrating its frustrating to see men blow it and win and we hold ourselves to these crazy crazy standards wolf pack fail up blow it and win rule two lead from the bench imagine this youve scored more goals than any human being on the planet—female or male youve cocaptained and led team usa in almost every category for the past decade and you and your coach sit down and decide together that you wont be a starter in your last world cup for team usa so that sucked youll feel benched sometimes too youll be passed over for the promotion taken off the project—you might even find yourself holding a baby instead of a briefcase—watching your colleagues get ahead heres whats important you are allowed to be disappointed when it feels like lifes benched you what you arent allowed to do is miss your opportunity to lead from the bench during that last world cupmy teammates told me that my presence my support my vocal and relentless belief in them from the bench is what gave them the confidence they needed to win us that championship if youre not a leader on the bench dont call yourself a leader on the field youre either a leader everywhere or nowhere and by the way the fiercest leading ive ever seen has been done between mother and child parenting is no bench it just might be the big game wolf pack wherever youre put lead from there rule three champion each other during every  soccer match there are a few magical moments when the ball actually hits the back of the net and a goal is scored when this happens it means that everything has come together perfectly—the perfect pass the perfectly timed run every player in the right place at exactly the right time all of this culminating in a moment in which one player scores that goal what happens next on the field is what transforms a bunch of individual women into a team teammates from all over the field rush toward the goal scorer it appears that were celebrating her but what were really celebrating is every player every coach every practice every sprint every doubt and every failure that this one single goal represents you will not always be the goal scorer and when you are not—you better be rushing toward her women must champion each other this can be difficult for us women have been pitted against each other since the beginning of time for that one seat at the table scarcity has been planted inside of us and among us this scarcity is not our fault but it is our problem and it is within our power to create abundance for women where scarcity used to live as you go out into the world amplify each others voices demand seats for women people of color and all marginalized people at every table where decisions are made call out each others wins and just like we do on the field claim the success of one woman as a collective success for all women joy success power these are not pies where a bigger slice for her means a smaller slice for you these are infinite in any revolutionthe way to make something true starts with believing it is lets claim infinite joy success and power—together wolf pack her victory is your victory celebrate it rule four demand the ball when i was a teenager i was lucky enough to play with one of my heroesmichelle akers she needed a place to train since there was not yet a womens professional league michelle was tall like i am built like id be built and the most courageous soccer player id ever seen play she personified every one of my dreams we were playing a small sided scrimmage— against  we were eighteenyearolds and she was—michelle akers—a chiseled thirtyyearold powerhouse for the first three quarters of the game she was taking it easy on us coaching us teaching us about spacing timing and the tactics of the game by the fourth quartershe realized that because of all of this coaching her team was losing by three goals in that momentalight switched on inside of her she ran back to her own goalkeeper stood one yard away from her and screamed give me the effing ball and the goalkeeper gave her the effing ball and she took that ball and she dribbled through our entire effing team and she scored now this game was winners keepers so if you scored you got the ball back so as soon as michelle scored she ran back to her goalie stood a yard away from her and screamed give me the ball the keeper did and again she dribbled though us and scored and then she did it again and she took her team to victory michelle akers knew what her team needed from her at every moment of that game dont forget that until the fourth quarter leadership had required michelle to help support and teach but eventually leadership called her to demand the ball women at this moment in history leadership is calling us to say give me the effing ball give me the effing job give me the same pay that the guy next to me gets give me the promotion give me the microphone give me the oval office give me the respect ive earned and give it to my wolf pack too in closing i want to leave you with the most important thing ive learned since leaving soccer when i retired my sponsor gatorade surprised me at a meeting with the plan for my sendoff commercial the message was this forget me theyd nailed it they knew i wanted my legacy to be ensuring the future success of the sport id dedicated my life to if my name were forgotten that would mean that the women who came behind me were breaking records winning championships and pushing the game to new heights when i shot that commercial i cried a year later i found myself coaching my tenyear old daughters soccer team id coached them all the way to the championship humblebrag one day i was warming the team up doing a little shooting drill i was telling them a story about when i retired and one of those little girls looked up at me and said so what did you retire from and i looked down at her and i said soccer and she said oh who did you play for and i saidthe united states of america and she said oh does that mean you know alex morgan be careful what you wish for barnard they forgot me but thats okay being forgotten in my retirement didnt scare me what scared me was losing the identity the game gave me i defined myself as abby wambach soccer player—the one who showed up and gave  percent to my team and fought alongside my wolf pack to make a better future for the next generation without soccer who would i be a few months after retirement i began creating my new life i met glennon and our three children and i became a wife a mother a business owner and an activist and you know who i am now im still the same abby i still show up and give  percent—now to my new pack—and i still fight every day to make a better future for the next generation you see soccer didnt make me who i was i brought who i was to soccer and i get to bring who i am wherever i go and guess what so do you as you leave here today and everyday going forward dont just ask yourself what do i want to do ask yourself who do i want to be because the most important thing ive learned is that what you do will never define you who you are always will and who you are—barnard women—are the wolves surrounding you today is your wolf pack look around dont lose each other leave these sacred grounds united storm the valleys together and be our salvation '"

       "\"TRANSCRIPT\\n\\nThank you President Schlesinger. Your leadership and vision has kept Babson at the very top of its game and I\\x92m honored to be here today. Congratulations graduates! You have earned something special and your journey is just beginning.\\n \\n    When I was a little kid, I told my mom that when I grew up I was going to Babson to become a businessman. Now, quite unbelievably, I stand here with you today. The road I took to get here was not Forest Street. It was my own unique path.\\n \\n    Today, I\\x92d like to share four stories about opportunity, creativity, failure, and empathy. These four stories have companion insights that have colored the way I view business, happiness, and my own definition of success.\\n \\nMy First Story Is About Opportunity \\n \\n    From age six to ten, my mom had placed me in a program called Boy Rangers. It was a predecessor to Boy Scouts\\x97we were modeled after Native American Tribes. We made feathered headdresses, we paid wampum. In order to advance from Papoose to Warrior, we had to learn how to tie knots, we had to perform various feats of strength\\x97it was a whole thing. Because I was in Boy Rangers, I didn\\x92t have time to participate in little league baseball, pee-wee football, soccer, basketball and all the other sports kids my age were playing and learning.\\n \\n    So, by the time I got to high school and I wanted to be on one of the sports teams, I had no idea what I was doing. All the lines on the basketball court were incredibly intimidating. The rules of these sports were baffling to me but everyone else seemed fine. As a result, I held back during tryouts for fear that the coach would realize that I had no clue what I was doing. This of course meant that I was not going to get on any of the teams\\x97what coach wants a kid that doesn\\x92t even try? So I launched an investigation.\\n \\n    My research lead me to discover that there was a sport that my high school did not offer at the time\\x97lacrosse. If nobody knew how to play lacrosse, then everybody would be as clueless as I was. So, approached the school administration and asked, \\x93If I can find a coach and enough boys, can I start a lacrosse team?\\x94 They looked at me and said, \\x93Sure kid.\\x94 So, that\\x92s what I did\\x97I found a coach, rallied some boys and formed a scrappy lacrosse team. With my intimidation gone, it turned out that I was really good a lacrosse, the others elected me captain, and we were a good team.\\n \\n    This brings us to lesson number one: Opportunity Can Be Manufactured. Yes, you can wait around for the right set of circumstances to fall into place and then leap into action but you can also create those set of circumstances on your own. In so doing, you manufacture your own opportunities. This is as true for high school sports as it is for entrepreneurism or corporate culture. It has helped me immeasurably.\\n \\nMy Second Story Deals with Creativity \\n \\n    After high school, I went to college to study the arts. I got a job moving boxes on Beacon Hill for a publishing company. They were just transitioning from spray glue and x-acto knives to Photoshop and Apple Computers. One day, when the entire art department went out to lunch. I snuck onto one of the Macs and designed a book cover. I printed it out, matted it up, and slipped it in with the other covers headed for approval by sales and editorial in New York City.\\n \\n    When the art director returned from New York, he held up my work and asked, \\x93Who designed this cover?\\x94 With a box in my hands, I said, \\x93That was me.\\x94 He looked around and said, \\x93The box kid?\\x94 Turns out, my cover was chosen. Then, he ended up offering me a full time job as a book cover designer. This was my opportunity to work by the side of a master so I made the difficult decision to drop out of college and take advantage of this rare opportunity to be an apprentice.\\n \\n    This man is more than 30 years older than me so in addition to learning about design I would ask him everything ranging from, \\x93How did you know when to propose to your wife?\\x94 to, \\x93How much did you ask for your first salary?\\x94 People have been asking you questions the whole time you\\x92ve been here\\x97now you\\x92re graduating, you\\x92re done and it\\x92s time for you to start asking your own questions. (It\\x92s amazing what you can learn by being nosy.)\\n \\n    On my first official day as a designer, I walked into the art director\\x92s office and he called me over to his desk. He reached toward a shelf without even looking and took down a color guide. I stood quietly and watched as he slowly flipped through pages and pages of colors. Finally, he stopped in the range of light browns and mocha. He tore out one of the little perforated swatches. It was a chocolate color. He put it down on his desk, placed one finger on it, and slid it slowly toward me. He then stated, \\x93That is how I take my coffee.\\x94\\n \\n    As I was considering how to match that color at the local Dunkin\\x92 Donuts with just the right amount of cream, he laughed and told me it was a joke. So began my apprenticeship in graphic design and a new way of thinking. There is not just one great design for a book cover\\x97there are an infinite number of possible winners. Working with Steve taught me the second lesson I\\x92d like to share with you today: \\nCreativity is a renewable resource. Be as creative as you like, as often as you like, because you can never run out!\\n  Yes, you are all creative and don\\x92t fool yourself into thinking your not.\\n \\nFailure Is The Subject of My Third Story \\n \\n    There is a 1987 German romantic fantasy film directed by Wim Wenders originally titled Der Himmel über Berlin which translates as The Sky Over Berlin. Before I continue, a quick heads up\\x97there will be spoiler alerts. You should download this film anyway, the American version is called \\x93Wings of Desire.\\x94 Don\\x92t get the remake with Nick Cage. It\\x92s not good.\\n \\n    The movie is in part inspired by the poetry of Bohemian\\x96Austrian born Rainer Maria Rilke whose haunting images focus on the difficulty of closeness with wonderful things in a time of skepticism, isolation, and overwhelming anxiety. Kind of like the world you are about to enter. So, I thought this observation might possibly be of some help.\\n \\n    The setting is West Berlin in the late 1980s, toward the end of the Cold War. Two angels have been assigned to watch over Berlin\\x97they have been there forever, since before there was a city and before there were humans. Their job now is listening to the diverse thoughts of citizens but they are pure observers who cannot be seen or interact physically with the real world. Their existence as immortal beings is to preserve reality but avoid getting involved.\\n \\n    As you might imagine\\x97things do not go according to plan. Of the two angels Cassiel and Damiel, it is Damiel who falls in love with a talented and lovely but profoundly lonely circus trapeze artist named Marion. He longs to know what it will feel like to kiss her, to taste food, to hold a hot cup of coffee in his hands, in short\\x97what it feels like to live. So, he does the unimaginable. Damiel renounces his immortality and falls to earth\\x97naked and alone. He then pawns his angelic armor (which somehow fell with him\\x97and he gets a pretty good price).\\n \\n    Once he\\x92s bought some clothes, he sets out exploring the city. Eventually, he finds Marion at a bar and they lock eyes as if they had always known one another. Damiel is united with the woman for whom he has pined over and the film ends with, \\x93To Be Continued.\\x94 My third lesson to you is taken from Damiel\\x92s decision. In order to succeed spectacularly, you must be ready to fail spectacularly. In other words, you must be willing to die to achieve your goals. For legal purposes let me say, I\\x92m not actually suggesting you should die. I\\x92m just telling you, figuratively, to embrace failure.\\n \\nMy Fourth And Final Story Is About Empathy \\n \\n    Empathy is the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. Most of us are born with this gift but we\\x92ve not all learned how to access it readily or how to use it in productive and meaningful ways. Over the past ten years I have been developing large scale communication systems with social elements such as blogging platforms and more recently, Twitter. In the course of this work, it has been revealed to me that people are basically good and if you give them a simple way to help others, they will prove this to you every single day.\\n \\n    However, people too often consider altruism only after they have achieved financial success. This approach is flawed because it does not take into account the value of helping others. For many years now my wife and I have been helping teachers and students get the supplies they need through an organization called Donors Choose. The cost is often small but the reward is huge. When we help a class, we get an envelope in the mail. This envelope is full of handwritten thank you letters from young schoolchildren. These letters are simultaneously heartbreaking and hilarious. These letters are valuable.\\n  When I was growing up, I understood that helping others was a socially responsible thing to do but I never expected to see measurable results for my efforts. How was my meager contribution going to meaningfully impact poverty, hunger, or the spread of AIDS? Another organization I\\x92ve worked with does an excellent job of demonstrating exactly how big problems can actually be solved by simple choices and small contributions that we all make together.\\n \\n    Product RED shows that two pills a day brings moms, dads, and children from death\\x92s door to health. This \\x93Lazarus Effect\\x94 means they go back to school, back to work, back to life. The funding that I thought went into an abyss has a measurable impact. We can watch as an entire geo-economic region comes back to life. When that region is stabilized, we move to another. My final lesson to you today is this: There is compound interest in altruism\\x97the earlier you get started helping others, the more impact you will have over time.\\n \\n    We are all in this world together so when we help others, we also help ourselves. It\\x92s exciting to think about companies running along this premise. There can be a new way for business to get done with a higher level of ambition, and a more meaningful way of measuring success. Beyond immediate needs, more and more people are discovering value in selflessness. It\\x92s important that we learn how to recognize value before profit.\\n \\n    In conclusion, I encourage each of you to create your own opportunities, to be infinitely creative, to embrace failure with all your heart, to ask questions, and to take the time to walk in another person\\x92s shoes. Develop a strong sense of empathy and you will grow into wise and strong leaders. Keep these things in mind and you will not only change the world\\x97you\\x92ll have fun doing it. I\\x92m proud of you. Keep up the good work.\\n Biz Stone's Commencement Speech - Original Source »\\n \\nPosted on: 06.12.2011\\n  \\xa0\""

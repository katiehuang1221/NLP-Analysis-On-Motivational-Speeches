filmmaker i was born in indiaand i spent my whole life here inphiladelphia and im gonna tell you twoversions of my life so far both equallytrue this is an attempt to be real for asecond with each other this is gonna bea really unusual like commencementspeech well he was the first versionwent to nyu film school and twoscholarships graduated in a little overthree years made my first film at making me one of the youngestprofessional filmmakers in history soldan original script in one of the biggestbidding wars of the time and then wenton to be a writer on three films thatwent on to be the three biggest films ofthat year for three studios one of themwas a sixth sensei wrote a  directed at  went on toone to become one of the biggest filmsof all time wrote and directed nonstopfrom then till now culminating in overthree billion dollars in the theatersmost of which came from an originalmovies out of my head word for word icould i could argue that i am thehighest paid writer in the world ivebeen offered every franchise film youcan imagine everything ive ever writtensince puberty has been offered to bemade into a film my films have openednumber one in every country in the worldcountless times most likely every adultin this stadium has seen one of my filmsmost likely every one of these adultshas given me money i have never had ajob other than a filmmaker i walk into aroom with other filmmakers and the wordi hear most often his honor its anhonor to meet youi mean artists from around the world andthey say you are an icon so now heresthe second version of my career made afilm at  it was pulled from onetheater in two weeks made a second filmthat was pulled from a handful oftheaters in a couple weeks the secondfilm was reviewed by major reviewers anddespised twotime failure  living inmy parents guestroom with my new wifesold a script to fox and was immediatelyfired by them as the director show myfilm is sick sense to people no onethinks it will work dumps to get todumped in the worst released time of theyear back then make a few hit films in arow then make a film that newsweek callsthe worst film of the year whencountless awards for failure and lack oftalent as the years go by there was aninternet blog mocking me and raisingmoney to send me back to film schoolthere is hatred from critics andbloggers alike i make childrens filmsthat get roasted and fail have a pressscreening of a film that i love and inthe middle of the press screening aperson stands up and says this filmsucks never happened before or after astudios computer gets hacked in thosehacks there are released emails that saythey dont believe in me and wouldnthire me find myself questioning myselfevery thought that comes out of my headthe world of my industry has decided ihave no worth i am a cautionary tale aperson who got lucky for a time butrevealed himself to be a sham i make anindependent film that i pay for andevery single studio passes i am on theverge of financial collapsei do not believe in myself how do weexplain these two versions of a life howdoes this all make sense you know it didmake sense to me and i can go back andunderstand it all because there was aprinciple at work and i didnt see it iwas incredibly powerful at every step ofthe wayand i didnt see it i am here to putforth the theory that every one of youis insanely powerful and dont know itlet me tell you the moment kind of thisall started to make sense to meso i told you i decided to pay for afilm write this independent film well itook a loan against our house and thiswas kind of a time when nobody wascalling nobody wanted to make a filmwith me so i dont know this was out ofcourage or just desperation but i took aloan against our house and i made a filmwithout anybodys permission so i wentto shot the movie and six weeks after ifinished it i was so nervous about whatid done i wanted to show the filmstudios the movie to get one of them tobuy it so i would know id be safebefore i finished the film i flew out tolos angeles and i showed it to everystudio everyone passed now passed meanstheyre not interested thats kind of aindustry term i flew home in a daze iwas going to lose millions and have tosell the movie to videoondemand and noone would see it and the world wouldknow id made a film that wasunreleasable i came home into my houseand i saw my family i was really quietobviously i was in the days and myyoungest daughter whos here somewherewas in the in the dining room and therewas a puzzle box there that she wantedto do that we were given and i promisedher we would do this puzzle and i juststanding there in a daze and i was likeyou want to do the puzzle i asked hersoftly and she said yeah she was reallyexcited so we opened up the puzzle boxdumped all the pieces thousand pieces onthe dining table when we started thepuzzle and we took like you know tenminutes  minutes and looked and triedto find the shape and we found twopieces that fit together and then wespent another like  minutes and wefound a second piece you know twoto put it together another one and i waslike this is impossible this is justimpossible and we spend another  minutes and found another piece andanother   minutes and found anotherpiece and another and another and wereabout like two hours in now and we havelike  to  pieces and were ecstaticand we feel so accomplished and excitedand it hits me it all suddenly felt soso simple why did we keep looking foranother piece why didnt we just stopwhy didnt we give up how do we findthose  to  pieces because we knewthere was a picture its right there onthe box its right there and then itkind of kind of i mean i literallyremember this moment in the dining roomi it all felt suddenly so simpleintensely simple and right i dont needto know what the picture is of my life ijust have to trust there is a picturefind the next next puzzle piece andtrust dont try to figure out thepicture dont try to fight all thepieces at once find one piece trust therest i felt relief and more to the pointi felt powerful so i went into theediting room the next day and i justmade one scene better just one momentbetter and i just concentrated you knowtry to different take you know move theline a little bit tried a different youknow sound effect here made that momentbetter then i made another moment betterand another moment better and anothermoment better and i just stoppedthinking about selling the movie istopped thinking about what was gonnahappen to me and i just got addictedthis feeling of finding that that nextthing making that next thing better andi just did that day after day after dayafter day and then when i was almostdone i was like i want i know who i wantto show  there was one studio that saidthey wouldnt mind seeing it when it wasdone and so when i finished it we wentto a movie theater in los angeles and iasked this one studio to come out therewe showed them the movie in front of anaudience the audience went crazy theybought the movie that movie was thevisit was bought by the universalpictures andwent on to become one of the biggestindependent movies of that year and itcosts five million dollars thank youand it made it made a hundred milliondollars and i owned it and then i paidfor my next film split and that costnine million dollars and that grows twohundred and eighty million dollars andthen i just paid for the next movieglass i tried to make sense of all ofthis but i just told you guys what was ifeeling at the puzzle why did i feel sopowerful and how did that manifest intoreality in the real world how is itsometimes in life i felt powerful andsometimes not how was i getting theseconflicting signals how come the systemheld me in place where it wanted to andother times i could do what i wantedthen i came across this philosopherepictetus epictetus is a greekphilosopher about  years ago and inhis book called a hamburger he talksabout to you how the universe worksto believe epictetus his philosophy youhave to believe one thing you have tobelieve the universe is fundamentallybenevolent fundamentally good this isjust something you just gotta you justgotta accept in your dna in your boneshe delineate it delineates between thosethings that we have power over and thosethings the universe has power over atany moment in our lives we have controlover countless things including ourthoughts and that is enough when we tryto put a control or put our energy intothose things the universe has controlover it will back and you and teach youotherwise it is in this dynamic that weget confused where we start to feelfalsely powerless if you write a songput all your energy in the emotion andthe craft of writing the song spend noenergy on how it will be received afterthat thats the universes job it maywant you to fail on your first fewalbums but let you find the exact rightwriting partner that lets you dig deeperand find that point of view that willchange the world it is none of yourconcern how the universe helps you youjust have to believethe universe is moving on your behalf tolet you grow and give you countlessopportunities to do what you are doingyou got fired in the field that you lovethere was a reason one that will helpyou what do you have control over atthat moment that is enougha person who concentrates on what theyhave power over becomes unlimited intheir ability to manifest what they wantin the world what do you have controlover and leave the rest of the controlof the universe its on your side donttry to get involved in its businessyoure gonna get smacked this kind ofdovetails with my belief that we arepowerful antennas and whatever we areconcentrating on and doing draws likethings this is all probably physicsactually the movement of energy and wecall it the universe and some peoplecall it god we are extremely powerful iwanna give you a couple little anecdotesa couple of stories one is actually froma friend of mine frank marshall whos aproducer i did not ask his permission totell the story so he men kept saying butwhen he was younger he was in italy andhe was working on a film he was anassociate producer working on a film fora director named peter bogdanovich andthis was a long time ago and it was initaly and they were having lunch and ayoung filmmaker named steven spielbergcame to visit the sets and they sat downhe told me the story they sat down forthe lunch and peter bogdanovich thedirector said hey can you fix that x whydid you guys take care of that xyzproblem im really worried about thisand frank sat down at the table and allthe pasta was laid out for everybody andhe just got up and said im gonna takecare of this right now and he left andsteven spielberg saw that frank got upand didnt eat his pasta and this littlemoment stuck in stevens head and goes hethought to himself gosh i mean i wantsomebody like that helping me make mymovies fast forward to a beach many manymany years agolater and george lucas and stevenspielberg are talking about making amovie and steven set and steven says imgonna direct james bond and and thengeorge lucas says no no i got a bettercharacter hes an archaeologist tellshim the story and stevens like im inim and ill direct it and then they saywell who should produce it and thensteven says oh whoa thisa long time ago im gonna check out andsee where he is so he calls up frankmarshall and asked him to be theproducer of raiders of the lost ark andfrank goes on to become one of the mostprolific producers of all time includingproducing three of my movies does doesliterally does stephen remember this manif he isnt entirely about the thingsthat are important to him if heliterally eats that pasta does he notbecome the biggest producer of all timeand i think about that story a lot imgonna tell you another one in dartford england theres aseventeen year old boy hes obsessedwith american blues in specific chicagoblues man spends all his time on thelistening the radio and trying to findthese american records you know whichwere hard to find in london at that timeall he does is think about blues andmusic and plays guitar so one day hessitting at a train station and he seesanother kid around his age waiting forthe train this kid thats standing thereand waiting for the train is holding achuck berry album and a muddy watersalbum the  year old sitting down getsup goes over to this kid and says howdid you how do you get these albums whatwhat how did you do this what why areyou all these albums and the two kidsstart talking to kids only the albumsays oh i know a record the place thathas these and ungar an underground placelets go they talk about blues and allthat stuff the boy on the bench at thetrain station is keith richards maybethe greatest rock and roll guitarists ofall time and the boy with the records ismick jagger maybe the greatest rock androll lead singer of all time they go onvery soon after that meeting to createthe rolling stonesso was that luck hes a god whos keithrichards concentrating so much on whathe got control over that he noticed whatthe boy was holding he could have easilybeen looking at the pretty woman thatwas waiting for the train or the dad whowas yelling at the son or he could hecould have been staring at nothingwhatever he was focused on was there tobe seen did the universe bring thegreatest rock n roll singer to the trainstation of the exact right moment withthose albums did the universe make surehe was holding it in his left hand andnot his right handand for you critics out there was itjust luck but see this kind of stuffkeeps happening to me over and over andover the exact right thing i need to seeher have happen happens when im focusedwith clarity like an antenna like we allare i concentrated on a character thatcan play  personalities ones a childones a woman has to be scary has to bebeautiful he has to be yes it has tomake us root for him and literally jamesmcavoy bumps into me at an event ivenever met the manhe could have walked around the tablesgoing to a bar and he could have hecould have gone that way went two feetthis way and he came and bumped into meand as soon as i met him im like thisis the guy and he gave an extraordinaryperformance and im not sure if anybodycould have played that part except thatone man that bumped into me and idnever met him beforehappens over and over and over to mewhat im saying is really hard to holdon to i get that its really hard towhen youre trying to believe you havesomething worthy to contribute you willface stages as the system tries to likeyou know hold you back a bit itll startwith your your voice is not worthy thenyou just keep fighting youll get to thenext stage which is hey man your voiceis just not relatable then you get tothe next stage if you keep pushingthrough hey maybe theres somethingthere we can guide if you startlistening to the system enough then youkeep pushing forward and you get towhatevers working in your voice is notsustainable its a fluke and then youkeep working and you keep concentratingthe things you have control over and youget to hey yeah your voice is greatwere gonna put it in the system and thesystem changes the same thing goes onwith my original movies it starts outlike its always the same this isterrible this is a mess then the next asyou work on it and work on it work on itthen its like oh this has a ton ofproblems its too weird and then itgraduates  hey parts of it work then itgoes  its pretty good but x y zexpected thing is better and then itfinally goes  i knew that was great allalong many times ive stopped at one ofthese stages and agreed other times ivepowered through to my own truth like thevisit with the puzzle pieces whichremind me where my power is ive a slatefrom powerful to powerless how patheticand inspiring i am just vacillating backand forth in equal measuresthe system has preprogrammed me tobelieve the prior its why ourbasketball players missed their openshots they dont realize theyre incomplete control of the outcome andbelieve they might be powerless and thecircumstances will prove that you canyou can see it as theyre taking thatshot when it goes from the things theyhave the control over to wondering whatwill happen which is the universes jobits why we shove away someone we loveand were getting intimate with we feelthe need to protect ourselves becausewere not in control of the outcome andwell get hurt by what the universesends us our fear of what we have powerover our actions our gestures our wordsour thoughts isnt enough we grab forwhat the universe has control over andheres the strange part we are allbizarrely scared of our own power everytime we feel it we shut down startfearing it isnt true waiting forsomething bad to happen to disprove whatwe just experienced this leads todestructive postures and actions andmore to the point we put our energy intothe things the universe has control overand feel powerless and the cycle spiralsi can feel it in me when im worryingabout the reaction to the ideas i haveversus working on the execution of thosesame ideas we keep wanting to make surethe outcome is what we want just trustthe universe is on our side my wife andi my wife dr bob neshama and i have afoundation the am night shyamalanfoundation we have leaders around theworld that moved their communitiesforward despite impossible oddswe support individuals that concentrateon what they have control over and doseemingly impossible things in hopelesssituations you guys might think hey manyou know youre older ill figure thisout when i get older you know though imdown the road a bit well lets look at agroup of people that are before youactually im particularly interested inthe achievement gap in america where myeducation graduates where theyhow many of you the rest of you knowwhat this is the education got theachievement gap this is the gap betweenlowincome innercity schools which are african american and hispanic andtheir white suburban counterparts andthis has existed forever and continuesto to this day and it drives me crazy iwrote a book called i got schooled a fewyears ago based on our research ourfoundation did by scouring educationstudies the united states over the last years i went in there thinking andlooking for why these schools were badand what i found out theres nothingwrong with these schools the data wasreally clear if you really look at itits outside the schools that there is aproblem those kids walk in there with abelief system so strong that we createdbasically the data says america isracistthose kids are being whispered to andyelled at in every form from movies towhat stores are on their block to imagesthey see to their friends and loved onesattitudes from their own experiencesthey have everyone is telling them thesame message its country is not for youyou are worthless you dont matter youare powerless the things that data showsclose the achievement gap are allrelated to belief systems and thedissemination of those new beliefs didyou know that twothirds of the entireachievement gap between lowincomeinnercity kids that are black andhispanic and their white suburbancounterparts happens in the summer youheard me rightif there was a kid in the innercitylowincome school and theres a whitesuburban kid and theyre at the samelevel in june when they come back inseptember the white suburban kid is onemonth ahead and that lowincomeinnercity kid is three months behind inseptember theyre four months apartthey dont even they dont even looklike the same students and after beepthat and that happens because theyregetting pummeled by subtle and notsubtle messaging that tells them thatthey are useless and they believe itsummer after summer it builds andseparates these two children and theydont even look comparable the tenantsof the principles that close theachievement gapclose it by screaming a culture ofempowerment so loud its louder than theracist message we see shout to them whenthey are out of school and these kidsclose the gap in fact they canoutperform the white suburban kids wehave one leaderalejandro daugherty guys that works withkids and families for five weeks overthe summer and achieves a three monthreading game that stays with themthroughout the school year if you do inthe math they are six months ahead oftheir other innercity lowincome peersand two months ahead of their whitesuburban counterparts these kids thatare closing the gap are and creating agap the other way are being taught toconcentrate on those things they havecontrol over unlearning the helplessnessthat was injected into their dna by acountry that was built with the sin ofslavery in its veins what i believe isthat this is a direct line from years ago to the achievement gap abelief systemwhy didnt every single one of the graduating class stand up and roar andcheer when i asked them what was goingthat if they were going to change theworld the banality of life sometimeslulls us into believing there isnt thismatrix like power over the world that weare this powerful that those that standbefore you like myself have some magicpower you know i didnt come here toadvise youi came here to demand you stoppretending and leave me the systemtricks us into thinking we are powerlessand the system will give us power whenit deems fit but heres the amazingthing the system is made up caps thegowns were wearing the chairseverythings made up art the the lengthof a record was you know that song ismade by the size of the record seatbeltsnot being on buses bands leaving thestage and coming back for an encore thedairy industry is good for you we dontknow how to make electric cars the lawsthe electoral system based on protectingthose states with slaves its all madeup why not you why did you buy into thisgarbage that you are not the creators ofthis worldwhen you when did you turn into thoselittle innercity africanamerican andspanish kids who believe they are notsmart when did you start on the journeyto be like meand vacillate and discredit truth as ithappens to mewhen did you abdicate your power tostarts and start secretly cursing theuniverse i didnt come here to lectureyou and say be like me i came here tosay bet to say be better than me be waybetter than me weve all been told thelie its what kept you in those damnseats that someone else decided thewidth and the depth and the curve of andby the way its bad for you someone elsedecided how you were going to sit andyou know what happens when when youdont realize your power a wannabeartist gets rejected from art school andconvinces an entire country to killjewish people skewer babies on treelimbs a megalomaniac can subvert aplanet and human rights in the name ofprotecting an antiquated idea of americaa person can walk into a school andshoot children these people feelpowerless and they find power by showingthe illusion of the system feel in someperverted way powerful by exposing thesame line its not healthy for any oneof us to not feel powerful its nothealthy for humanity i didnt come hereto lecture you i came here to yell atyou you cant sit in your damn seats youhavent succeeded at the highest levelgraduating from one of the finestinstitutions in the world by doing whateveryone told you to do in the way theytold you to do it now stop itwe dont need another  souls goingon in the world thinking they arepowerless unless they succeed at asystem that was laid out for them beforethem i dont accept you are too young toknow better i dont accept yourpassivity i dont accept your fears youhave told yourself theres enough peoplegraduating today in this stadium justthis place to change everything periodevery law every medical practice everyart form every way our society relateshow we treat the mentally illwe treat those that dont look like usyou are powerful beyond your wildestdreams right nowepictetus was right the universe is justwaiting for you waiting and listeningwaiting for you to say something now imgonna ask you again one last time andyou better answer it right because ihave three daughters and youreresponsible for them from this point onyoure responsible for all our sons anddaughters class of  how many of youare going to change the world thank youfor listening my theory of you guysthat that wasnt a commencement speechthat was a gift take

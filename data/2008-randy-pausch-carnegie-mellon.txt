I'm glad to be here today

hell I'm glad to be anywhere today

president Cohen asked me to come and

give the charge to the graduates I

assure you it's nothing compared to the

charge you have just given me this is an

incredible place I've seen it through so

many lenses I saw it when I was a

graduate student that didn't get

admitted and then somebody invited me

back and said okay we'll change our mind

and I saw it as a place that hired me

back to be on the faculty many years

later and then gave me the chance to do

what anybody wants to do which is follow

their passion follow their heart and do

the things they're excited about and the

great thing about this university unlike

almost other ones I know of is that

nobody gets in your way when you try to

do it and that's just fantastic and to

the degree that a human being can love

an institution I love this place

and I love all of the people and I'm

very grateful to Jerry Cohen and

everyone else for all the kindness that

had been shown me last August I was told

that in all likelihood I had 3 to 6

months left to live I'm on month 9 now

and I'm not going to get down and do any

push-ups

but there will be a short pickup

basketball game later somebody said to

me in light of those numbers wow so

you're really beating the Grim Reaper

and what I said without even thinking

about is we don't beat the reaper by

living longer we beat the reaper by

living well and living fully for the

Reaper will come for all of us the

question is what do we do between the

time were born and the time he shows up

because when he shows up it's too late

to do all the things that you're always

going to kind of get around to so I

think the only advice I can give you on

how to live your life well is first off

remember it's a cliche but I love

cliches it is not the things we do in

life that we regret on our deathbed it

is the things we do not because I assure

you I've done a lot of really stupid

things and none of them bother me all

the mistakes and all the dopey things

and all the times I was embarrassed they

don't matter

what matters is that I can kind of look

back and say pretty much any time I got

a chance to do something cool I tried to

grab for it and that's where my solace

comes from the second thing that I would

add to that and I didn't coordinate on

the subject of this word but I think

it's the right word that comes up is

passion and you will need to find your

passion many of you have already done it

many of you will later many of you may

take til your 30s or 40s but don't give

up on finding it

right because then all you're doing is

waiting for the reboot find your passion

and follow it and if there is anything I

have learned in my life you will not

find that passion in things and you will

not find that passion in money because

the more things and the more money you

have the more you will just look around

and use that as the metric and there

will always be someone with more so your

passion must come from the things that

fuel you from the inside and honors and

awards are nice things but only to the

extent that they regard the real respect

from your peers and to be thought well

of by other people that you think even

more highly of is a tremendous honor

that I've been granted find your passion

and in my experience no matter what you

do at work or what you do in official

settings that passion will be grounded

in people and it will be pounded in the

relationships you have with people and

what they think of you when your time

comes and if you can gain the respect of

those around you and the passion and

true love and I've said this before but

I waited till 39 to get married because

I had to wait that long to find someone

where her happiness was more important

than mine and if nothing else I hope

that all of you can find that kind of

passion and that kind of love in your

life thank

you

we know several years ago when I first

came I asked when is the all campus

graduation going to take place and the

answer was huh so I figured it's time to

come to you and tell you a little bit

about what you'd would have accomplished

over the last several years it was the

best of times it was the worst of times

it was the age of wisdom it was the age

of foolishness so began the Tale of Two

Cities by Charles Dickens written more

than a century ago and that opening line

still resonates today this is an

exciting time for you or it should be

you come to the conclusion you come to

the conclusion that your studies at UC

San Diego are behind you you're ready to

apply your knowledge to your chosen

field and yet with a shrinking workforce

you it is becoming more and more

competitive fortunately for you as you

leave UC San Diego you have a UC San

Diego education and that means something

mr. University has not only provided you

with the skills you need for your future

we've also taught you to be good global

citizens to examine issues from a

variety of perspectives to be creators

and innovators with a UC San Diego

education you can do anything that you

set your mind to

case in point today's keynote speaker

Mike judge Mike majored in physics and

then he went on to be and have a second

successful career as the creator behind

films and TV shows such as office space

king of the hill and beavis and

butt-head I never thought I'd say that

beavis and butthead was the beauty of a

UC San Diego education

[Applause]

that's what you've learned to work

across disciplines and you have various

job descriptions I think you'll be happy

that your parents should be included in

that they know that they're done paying

fees and you should also know that UC

San Diego alumni ranked third in the

nation in salary earnings among public

universities I also want you to know you

have a support system here you will

continue to succeed in your future

endeavors and as you do I hope that you

will keep tapped with the alumni network

take advantage of our Career Services

stay connected with the University

because this is your University where

you've made memories and life taught

lifelong friends where you've learned

and expanded your mind where you've

grown academically and as a person this

university is part of you and you are an

important part of the university we

expect to see you back on campus often

in fact we've got exciting alumni events

occurring each year homecoming in fall

the young Alumni Reunion in winter and

Alumni Weekend in the spring and of

course we want you to join UC San

Diego's fiftieth anniversary celebration

which is next year so mark your

calendars November 16 2010 it'll be

quite a show but today we celebrate you

and your milestones so go out there

apply the education and experience

you've learned here make a difference in

your community and in the world so now

I'd like to wrap up by reading a portion

of a commencement speech given by our

own dr. Seuss in 1978 at a UCSD commit

convincement

commencement here's how he began I've

been brought here this morning at the

enormous expense of precisely one dollar

and 55 cents plus 19 cents more if you

add on the tip to the driver who drove

on this hazardous

trip from the wilds of loya far far to

the south so you can hear wisdom pour

forth from my mouth it's been brought

here to warn you of stress and strife

that you'll face as you bravely ride

forth into life such as the lamentable

instability of your fast shrinking

dollars and the current crisis and the

market marketability of kangaroo collars

you'll be faced with the problems of

armament treaties and would Bruce Jenner

would have won the Olympics had he

failed to eat his Wheaties I'm gonna

skip a little bit I'm throwing the rest

of my compendium away I'll say one

single good thing I can say as you leap

on your horses and enter the fray I wish

you good luck and an hasta luego

from you sees La Jolla I mean San Diego

good luck and congratulations it gives

me great great pleasure at this time to

introduce you our alumnus speaker Mike

judge we've been waiting for this day

for many many many months as Chancellor

Fox mentioned Mike has uh has created so

many incredible films TV series he's an

Emmy Award winner but many of you

probably will also recognize his voice

and see his face as he's appeared in

many many of his films I think you're in

for a great treat we've had the pleasure

of having Mike with us all day visiting

various parts of campus meeting with

students and faculty and one of the

things that just came out so clearly to

all of us is that although his creative

genius and really truly symbolizes what

a UCSD alumni is all about what being an

alumnus is about through his creativity

what he's always demonstrated to do

through his work is to show what is the

the sense of compassion in very

seemingly ordinary ways through his

character so for that we appreciate him

and we're very proud to call him a

member of our alumni family ladies and

gentlemen Mike judge

[Applause]

graduating class of 2009 okay now that

I've got that over with I will do the

rest of the speech in my normal voice

boy I tell you what class of 2009

faculty alumni and friends it is indeed

my pleasure to be with you this

afternoon yeah man I think women don't

let her down Chancellor Fox with me BAM

humbug you guys in them dang old thank

you very much okay I wanted to see how

he's gonna sign Boomhauer

now I know I probably wasn't asked to

speak here because of my political views

on the Middle East or my philosophical

contemplations on where the soul ends

and the man begins

I was probably asked here to to speak

because of the gum laughs I did and so I

won't go on too long I was I was talking

to a lot of the students today and I

know that jobs are kind of on everyone's

mind and a lot of people are asking me

like you know how do I break into

entertainment business movies TV how do

I become a comedy writer and what I

usually tell them is the first thing you

want to do is major in physics so I'll

tell you a quick version of the my

humble story of my crooked path from

graduating with a degree in physics here

in 85 from this fine University to

creating what is widely considered to be

one of the dumbest shows in the history

of television hopefully there'll be a

lesson in there somewhere there you go

when I started here in the Warren dorms

28 years ago I was Portola Hall still

there I was uh I was very intimidated by

San Diego and California in general I

remember in during Welcome Week this

girl who actually was the Chancellor's

daughter asked said oh where are you

from and I said Albuquerque New Mexico

and she said oh really where are you

from and I was very kind of had this I

was intimidated I'd always had this

dream about going into comedy and

animation sketch comedy maybe I had

always done imitations of teachers and

stuff but I didn't think that that was a

possibility for me I didn't have any

connections as from Albuquerque

you know so I went and got my degree in

physics and I graduated in 1985 and my

generation I think high school guidance

counselor's and adults in general had us

all convinced that if you got a degree

in science jobs would just come raining

out of the sky we were just like you'd

get like it would solve all the world's

problems if we all had degrees in

science because there wouldn't be any

world hunger everyone would have a job

at Motorola we'd be driving Corvettes

and I I bought into this and I didn't

even I was I did yeah I'll get maybe

I'll get to that

um I anyway I didn't do any on-campus

interviews I was I was golden boy with

my physics degree I just thought I was

gonna get a job and well it turns out

that wasn't true at all

at least not for me and to make things

worse I've moved into this I was

subletting this room from a friend of

mine who was travelling abroad so I'd

paid him all the rent for the summer and

what he didn't tell me was that his

roommate was dealing speed and

apparently not a very successful speed

dealer because he hadn't paid the rent

so we were being evicted so here I paid

all my rent to a guy who was often Egypt

and I was having to dodge Process

Servers and all this stuff the

experience of being evicted without

getting to have the experience of not

paying rent I and then so this guy also

he hadn't paid the the phone bill and

this is before cell phone so all the all

my resumes I'd sent out had this phone

number on it and it got shut off so by

the way you want to know where that

speed dealer is today sitting right on

this stage ladies gentleman

vice-chancellor our mean of South I'm

just kidding I'm just kidding

I also know if if our mean was to deal

speed I think he would be very

successful at it the compassion he shows

so anyway my last 200 dollars was stolen

actually had $50 in my pocket

I hit rock bottom couldn't get a job

because didn't have a phone there's a

song about that anyway um I I had a

little bit of a break I started playing

bass with this drunken redneck guy blues

guy named blond Bruce I hope he's not

still playing and I managed to get

enough money to get the phone put back

on just in time to just barely get a job

so I was you know August of 85 you

wouldn't find anybody as happy to have

this job as I was and and until about

maybe three or four days in when I was I

just kind of hit me like wow this so

this is it this was you know I'd had a

ton of job I mean I'd worked everything

from being a paperboy jack-in-the-box

physics ta m√®re cafeteria I was going to

pause for applause for the MIR cafeteria

I was sure

but you know this was supposed to be the

good job this was and I actually did I

did like the people I worked with but

you know something about my destiny

wasn't in my control and I got I like

these people I was working with that I

got transferred into this different

group and I was in this room with a

bunch of really weird guys middle-aged

creepy I'm middle-aged now but you know

I was 22 at the time it was one guy I

asked him she just never said anything I

kind of wondered about him and I just

said one day I just said hey how's it

going I won't say what his name is and

he just started saying this thing about

like if they move my dish one more

Taemin quitting the window and I had

opened the floodgates and he went on

about his fish tank and how he had a I

think he had a mail-order bride I heard

actually Dan I didn't want to know

anything more about him then so then I

quit that job I moved to the Bay Area

mostly to follow my girlfriend at the

time who would later become my wife and

then later my ex-wife she was also a

UCSD graduate in physics now this was in

in the mid 80s the bay area was just it

was just overachiever fever the whole

like that mentality was just really

intense and it was in ground zero for it

was Silicon Valley and remember is it

before the Internet you'd look for jobs

in the paper I don't know if you guys

still do it there my son Sun

Microsystems had an entire page added

the front and giant letters it just said

push and then underneath that it said

yourself harder than you ever dreamed

possible past all existing goals up to

the level of Sun Microsystems and this

scared me and disturbed me I just

I was looking at this and I thought

because I don't dream about pushing

myself harder than I thought possible I

dream about like sitting on the beach in

Hawaii with the beer or you know place

out in the country and so it's kind of

like looking at the sky what do I do and

I ended up getting this job at this

place with parallax called parallax

and I was again grateful for my job I

get there the first day and it was like

I was walking into this bizarre cult it

was a company of about 50 people and

everybody was already there when I got

there there was I got there 10 minutes

early for my first day and and then had

no rapport with anybody I couldn't

relate to anybody nobody was sitting

around just you know having any idle

conversation and so I around by the time

lunch time came around I actually left

for what my deal was 8:00 to 6:00 with

an hour for lunch well nobody left for

lunch except for me

first day and I I was just counting the

hours until 6 o'clock and then 6 o'clock

rolls around everybody's still there

like nobody's leaving

and 6:30 and then 7 and this guy Hilden

who was just on me all day like he comes

over and goes ok now I'm gonna get you

started on the Arty's

and I was just wanted to go home and at

7:30 I finally just made up an excuse

that I had to pick up someone from the

airport and I went home and I realized

wow this is this is just Monday and I

still have Tuesday Wednesday say and

then the next week and then the rest of

my life until I retire and so I ended up

calling in sick the following Monday and

then Tuesday that one of my many bosses

I had like five or ten of em on her

comes by and he goes mmm yeah

so you were sick yesterday huh I said

yeah mmm did you have a cold or

something and and it turned into the

most passive-aggressive conversation

I've ever been in and I lasted there

about two and a half three months I

probably called in sick three more

Mondays after that so anyway after this

one more engineering job and then I kind

of figured I shouldn't be wasting these

people's time and I threw in the towel

on that I'd always been a musician so I

I started doing that full-time and that

again you know I I wasn't a singer a

songwriter so my destiny wasn't in my

control it was in the control of

whatever drunken hillbilly was running

the band I was in Dallas toured around

this time I was married in Dallas and it

was around this time that I had a

life-changing moment actually kind of

two life-changing moments the first one

was I had this premonition that I was

going to get into a car wreck and the

steering wheel was going to go through

my testicles and so then I did get in a

car wreck I was hit by a drunk driver

but I was okay down there and this led

me to talk my wife into having our first

daughter immediately and and around the

same time the other big life-changing

moment I went to a animation festival

animation show and there's still some of

these I'm sure some of you guys have

been like the spike in Mike 1 and

whatever this one was called the

animation celebration was playing in

Dallas and I'd been to all of these and

I was I'd always wanted to do animation

and separately go into comedy was

different here's they had a there's a

local guy in Dallas this was films from

all over the world who had one of his

shorts had made it into this festival

and he had his drawings and his cells on

display in the lobby and it's something

about seeing those and and just going

realizing okay there's a guy right here

in my town doing this and he's you know

there must be a camera you can rent time

on and just the reality of that all

hit me all at once like just a ton of

bricks and there's suddenly for the

first time I was motivated I was a man

on a mission and you know actually for

the first time I kind of understood that

thing push yourself harder that you ever

thought possible I was and I was still a

musician at the time and I was you know

musician hours earliest I would wake up

would be noon and anything earlier than

that was just really tough well I woke

up the next morning at 8:30 just on my

own and from then on I was just I just

worked my butt off at it I was just I I

knew what I wanted to do I was motivated

I went to the library I got the books on

it and I got a little bollocks $200

bollocks camera just started animating

and it sounds kind of nerdy maybe and a

little weird but like I I think this was

probably the happiest I've ever been the

success that came later was really nice

but something about just toiling away

and just doing those hundreds of

drawings and being on a mission and

knowing that there were these

possibilities was was and having

something that motivated me after going

through all these jobs that I didn't

like was great I also had a you know my

wife at the time was not only supportive

but she had a job that she liked and I

was a good backstop so I ended up I

finished this but the first short I

finished was called office space and it

was about two minutes long took me about

eight weeks to animate it and so I had

this thing and I you know again I have

no connections in show business so

that's the part I always miss when I'm

watching somebody talk about how they

made it on TV there's this big section

missing of how do you how do you break

in

you know and

I didn't know how to I actually was kind

of embarrassed that I did this I just

called for one one and it said MTV

please I literally called Comedy Central

MTV animation festivals and that's the

press follow me everywhere I go I called

I call these places and you know of

course you know these some of these

receptionists are kind of mean and it's

their big opportunity to be mean to

somebody but I just you know I just kept

asking for addresses and I just mailed

out like 12 VHS tapes and within a week

or two I got calls from Comedy Central a

show called Kids in the Hall show called

night after night with Allen Havey I got

the animation festivals and it was just

like I couldn't believe it and I my

first thought was man why didn't I do

this when I was 19 I wouldn't got a

physics degree I had all those jobs like

but then as as my career went on I

realized it's a really good thing I

didn't do that because I for one thing I

got all that comedy material from all

those jobs and you know and in fact it

kind of became my trademark I think a

lot of people in entertainment come from

kind of upper-class backgrounds and go

straight into film school and a lot of

the movies are about other movies and

and so I kind of was able to find this

niche of doing stuff that was about real

life and also having all those you know

jobs I didn't like I had an appreciation

for what I do now and then it was just a

matter of you know working hard and and

putting up with Hollywood and battling

Hollywood and just you know for severan

now as a guy as the guy who made office

space I and you know you're all

graduating at I want to be careful I

don't want to say too many bad things

about jobs because I've probably done

enough damage already

and in fact when beavis and butthead and

king of the hill became shows I had

employees of my own probably as many as

70 to 90 and I began to sympathize with

my former bosses and realize it must

have been pretty frustrating to have

someone like me as an employee but I I

would point out I heard somebody talking

about this on CNBC it which is that the

job is a fairly recent concept in human

history it used to be that you know

you'd be the blacksmith in the village

or you'd be the guy who makes horseshoes

or furniture and you know business was

good or business was bad but you weren't

worried about unemployment you know like

the Vikings weren't worried about

unemployment jobs and and I think in

tough economic times if you can't find a

job or if you find like I did that you

just don't like most of the jobs I would

encourage you to go back to that older

way of thinking you know find something

people need or want willing to pay for I

found that people needed and wanted to

watch to dumbass

teenagers sitting on the couch watching

bad music videos you know hopefully

you'll find something more high-minded I

guess but tough economic times like this

have inspired people to do really great

things and start their own businesses

and find new ways you know to do

business and I don't think there's

anything wrong with jobs and and you

know when you work for other people that

can actually be really fulfilling and

exactly what you're looking for so don't

listen to me and if you find that that's

great and I hope that a lot of you have

jobs lined up but just you know there is

another path to take and if you take

that path it's really it's hard work and

you'll be right sometimes they'll be

wrong sometimes you know people will

doubt you you'll doubt yourself but if

you're doing something you want and have

a passion for or if you're working

towards doing something you want or have

a passion for at least you'll have that

to guide you and you should also know

there are a lot of means stupid bosses

out there but there are also some really

ones who do good things and when you

work for other people you'll find that

they do know what's best for them and

for the company and you should listen to

them and be respectful but they don't

know what's best for you only you know

that and whether you're working for

yourself or someone else you should

always try to find that and know that 24

years ago I was sitting right there or

maybe it was over there listening to you

know I don't remember who was giving the

commencement speech or anything they

said so you know maybe 24 years from now

one of you will be standing up here

giving the commencement speech and

forgetting who I am this was a great day

for me back then I hope it's a great day

for you thanks for having me I'm honored

to have been asked to be here and I'm

honored to have you all join me as

fellow alumni of UC San Diego so let's

raise a glass and watch some fireworks

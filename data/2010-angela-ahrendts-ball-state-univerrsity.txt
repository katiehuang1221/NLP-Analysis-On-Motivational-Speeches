good morning and thank you so much for

inviting me back to Ball State

University to celebrate with you today

Thank You president Korra dr. Whitaker

who many of you may not know is retiring

today after 34 years and thank you

faculty staff student family and friends

I can honestly say that speaking with

you today is one of the greatest honors

of my life it's been nearly 30 years

since I last studied here and yes for

those of you quickly doing the math that

means I'll celebrate my 50th birthday

next month 50 or as my teenage son likes

to say half a century now so thank you

so much for providing the stimulus to

truly stop reflect and take account of

the great lessons of my blessed life so

far this speechwriting journey is the

best 50th birthday gift I could have

been given and entitled from the heart

it's my gift to you today on our website

a couple of weeks ago it brought back

some really great memories one of you

reminded me of my college job at the

Muncie mall and it's funny because one

day you're studying and selling albums

at musicland

and the next thing you know 30 years

have passed and you receive a beautiful

letter from your university president

asking you to summarize your life's

journey in three simple thoughts for

14,000 people in 20 minutes well it's

been quite a journey and not just the

last three decades but the last few

months since I agreed to speak and after

thinking about it I thought maybe our

lives have been in parallel the final

semester I've been dreaming thinking

praying about what I could possibly say

that would resonate with you today touch

you and perhaps make a difference in the

next three decades of your life and I

imagine that your last few months have

not been dissimilar as you finish exams

term papers job search and dream of your

future

a bit unsettling huh this process has

been somewhat like writing my final term

paper and ironically I felt like the

student and you're now the grading

professor so take it easy on me let's

think of it more like American Idol I've

already won I'm just back to entertain

and inspire you today so this speech

writing journey it forced me to stop and

reflect in a way that I haven't done in

years where's there a professional story

that I could recall that would help

broaden your perspective where is there

a compelling strategic secret that I

could share that might jump start your

path to success

what message would be the most relevant

as this recession recedes and this

digital age accelerates I've not taken

my assignment lightly and thinking about

this question has required so much time

so I will apologize up front to my

husband and three children as this

process took too many precious weekends

away from them but their sacrifice did

allow a great personal discovery I

realized that the most important

component of my life that has guided

every aspect of my professional career

has been my Midwestern core values do

you realize that you may already possess

the foundation of your success you might

have the answer to the most important

test question in life wouldn't it be

great if you could answer it now and

take advantage of it versus midlife the

game-changing question is do you truly

know your core purpose your fundamental

reason for existence and can you clearly

articulate your core values your guiding

principles I absolutely love the way

that management guru Jim Collins raises

it for business he says a core purpose

is your reason for being it captures

your soul with the primary role to guide

and inspire and you cannot fulfill a

core purpose it's like a guiding star on

the horizon forever pursued

never reached Walt Disney's core purpose

is simple to make people happy

Burberry's core purpose is a little more

expansive to protect explore and inspire

what's your core purpose in life

your life book profile if you will and

your core values are the soulmate of

your core purpose they're your purest

beliefs your conscience your convictions

that rarely change throughout your life

because we live by what we believe not

by what we see and identifying your core

values early in life will help provide

great clarity into the type of

organization you want to work for the

type of people you want to be with and

the type of leader you aspire to be so

let's look at it from a from a less

theoretical perspective if you will if

you think your college years have flown

by just wait until action it's someone's

actually paying you to do what you love

I enjoy meeting with students as they

visited over the years in New York and

now London and interviewing recent

graduates as they tell me all they've

done during their university years and

how hard they've worked I remind them

that they were actually paying the

university to work it to work that hard

and I asked them if our company employs

them will they continue to work that

hard for us I also remind them that

their great education is what got them

the interview but it's who they truly

are that will get them the job getting

to understand a person's true values and

character sometimes in less than an hour

is a critical part of making sure a

candidate is culturally compatible funny

when I think of my core values I can't

help but think of my parents my father

who in my mind is one of this

generation's greatest philosophers used

to constantly remind me that you can

teach people anything but you can't

teach them to care caring or compassion

is of value and growing up I was always

told to put myself in the other person's

shoes to be aware and sensitive of my

impact on others recognizing it's often

not what you say but how you say it and

with Mother's Day tomorrow it's only

fitting to acknowledge what

powerful force my mother has been in my

life whenever I would ask her if

something were okay or fine she would

consistently reply I didn't raise you to

be fine

I'm sure sure that Jim Collins was

inspired by my mom when in his book good

to great he says good is the enemy of

great and the few people attain great

lives in large part because it's so easy

to settle for a good life being the best

I could be was a core value she

instilled in me from a very young age

along with my faith she would

conveniently remind me usually at my

laziest that God helps those who help

themselves and consistently remind me

usually at my lowest that I was never

alone another core value humility my dad

would always say when you look at a

photo do you see yourself last and then

would remind me of a line from Rudyard

Kipling's famous poem if or walk with

Kings nor lose the common touch and

funny because I always thought that was

so unrealistic and profitable but about

six months ago I was honored to sit next

to Prince Charles the future King of

England during a formal dinner at

Buckingham Palace and after talking with

him throughout the evening and then

returning to my daily work routine the

next morning this lesson became very

real so with the focus on your left

brain your education in the last few

years you may not have given much

thought to your right brain core values

but in this rapidly changing world they

are your emotional DNA and should

permeate anything anyone sees from you

off or online and once confirmed they

offer confidence in peace and their

significance and influence should never

be underestimated or compromised in this

virtual society the fact that the

identical core values which were

developed many years prior to actually

being out on my own at Ball State are

still the guiding force in my life today

was an epiphany and it only took me 20

years of youth 30 years of experience

and five months of reflecting to

discover this for you today this could

be your most important most marketable

asset your differentiator in this

digital age and if you can clearly

articulate the answer to this question

early in your life it could be your best

shortcut to success but while core

values are your foundation there's a lot

of other emotional facets such as dream

ease and passion fear and insecurity

underpinned by heart and faith that

provide additional guidance and

inspiration as your career commences

this speechwriting journey also serves

to highlight a few of these emotional

drivers again take when I received

president Gore's letter asking me to

speak after recovering from the initial

shock I mean I am NOT David Letterman I

quickly fell into what I call the dream

phase Megan if you are still with me

this section will hopefully answer your

web chat question the dream face is that

wow moment but let your imagination see

everything so positively it's a state of

euphoria cloud 9 that infatuation stage

of a new relationship you know the

feeling this dream state is a little

surreal

you're not thinking or purely feeling

both they're fused creating an energy

that just fuels your imagination dreams

are your most exciting thoughts your

future life in 3d and by envisioning in

your mind you are creating your life

roadmap whatever we focus on we become

at Burberry for example our catwalk

shows our chief creative officer

Christopher Bailey seasonal dreams they

inspire both art and commerce and help

us beyond our self-imposed boundaries

these shows also demonstrate four dreams

to become reality they must be backed by

passion and persistence be channeled and

largely immune to external opinions and

obstacles as the author Napoleon Hill

says nearly a hundred years ago this

changed world requires practical

dreamers who can and will put their

dreams into action but the dream phase

is often interrupted by the occasional

nightmare that insecure state when

you're conveniently reminded of

everything you don't know exposing the

brutal clarity the full reality of the

situation again take this Beach why did

the letter have to say live to 14,000

feet

and that it's only the university's

greatest tradition and only the most

important day of your life well I've

learned over the years that just as the

dream phase is critical the intermittent

nightmare is perfectly normal

he'll also stated that if you take

inventory of mental assets and liability

you will discover that our greatest

weakness is lack of self-confidence the

subconscious mind will translate into

reality a thought driven by fear just as

readily as that will translate into

reality a thought driven by courage or

faith it's how well you manage your fear

that will determine the outcome of your

dream you know it's funny because in

this insecure state I become a curious

student again so what to do with this

commencement speech of course I turn to

Google and spent the next few weeks

reading everyone's from Oakland Oprah

Winfrey's to Steve Jobs politicians

academics artists I also read the

experts advice what's appropriate what's

not how to organize how long who to

thank and the fact that the majority of

you will not remember most of what I've

said once the recessional begins you see

fear is simply a state of mind that

manage proactively makes you so much

more aware and in time more astute to

the subtle shifts going on around you

fear of failure has been a consistent

motivator in my life and helped me stay

passionate objective and focused on

achieving the desired result

so having confused yourself with the

facts

you passed the nightmare face your mind

is sufficiently sharp your confidence is

back and you begin to systematically

think through the solutions what with

the rational options in front of me my

mind at peace I've learned at this stage

to turn off my head and turn on my heart

you see if your dreams are your roadmap

your heart is your true guide the

intuitive feeling heart if listened to

will never mislead you in work a

relationship or with family and in this

digital age we are seemingly hardwired

to overthink our way through life and

almost instinctively to look outside for

heartfelt answers instead of within

ourselves we are bombarded with

information 24/7 and spent

much time responding to others rather

than listening in word technology has

given us access to the world and it's

sea of content allowing us to never

speak to another person if we don't want

to computers and smart devices are among

the greatest intellectual gifts ever

created for man but if not balanced with

human contact may offer little to

develop one's heart don't get me wrong I

am mesmerized by this digital tsunami

but Google doesn't have all the answers

and are all those people on Facebook

truly you're friends with Twitter and

texting you can share sound bites as

I've done with you the last few weeks

but they offer no substitute for real

human interaction which is why we

initiated the web chat in my many years

of traveling around this amazing planet

I have found that the heart is the one

global language we all instinctively

possess allowing us to communicate

across generations and cultures and at

times only with our eyes a simple

gesture or a touch so with the world at

your fingertips have you learned to

listen to your heart your intuition your

instincts have you learned to feel what

other others feel before you say a word

do you understand the lasting impact of

a smile or a simple thank you do you

truly do one to others as you would have

them do unto you your heart is a guiding

force teach yourself to listen to it to

nurture it and let it guide you as you

start the next exciting chapter of your

life reflecting vividly brought back my

early chapters and was a catalyst to the

realization but core values were the

consistent theme in my career as Joanna

mentioned I grew up about an hour from

here in a small town new Palestine

Indiana where I lived vicariously

through fashion magazines my dream at an

early age was to be in the fashion

industry and I dreamed night and day day

and night so much so that my father

would tell me to take off my

rose-colored glasses

I was dreaming then began praying and

soon began believing that

I could make it how my belief was

encouraged by small things coincidences

signs all around me and the first was in

the form of a little black book called

as a man thinketh it fell into my teen

lap and to this day I have absolutely no

idea why I began reading it but it

taught me early on the power of positive

thinking and of open mindedness and that

inner thoughts you choose and encouraged

we weave both your inner character and

your outer circumstances then larger

signs appeared like the one I ran to

into early on camp at a campus visit

with my older smarter sister who had

chosen to go to Ball State

they described upcoming merchandising

and marketing programs as a student the

following year I don't believe it was a

coincidence but I attended the summer

fashion program in New York where for

the first time I had a behind-the-scenes

view of the things I had been dreaming

about all those years this trip was a

fundamental turning point in my life my

road map was now clear and there was no

looking back and after three and a half

fast and fulfilling years in 1981 I left

college for New York City or as Alicia

King so brilliantly sings the concrete

jungle where dreams are made of classes

and didn't I flew out the next day with

nothing but my core values my dream my

heart my faith combined with a great

education and I was scared trust me but

I knew I wasn't alone and I kept

repeating to myself I will not live my

life saying I wish I would have at the

airport that day my dad was trying

desperately not to cry and my mom just

kept asking when I'd be coming home and

find me as I was boarding the plane I

turned and blurted out my lifelong dream

I said after I become the president of

Donna Karen I'll be home so of course as

realistic moms do she prepared for a

long absence about 10 years later I was

sitting in my new office on 7th Avenue

when the phone rang who else but mom she

said congratulations you're now the

president of Donna Karen when are you

coming home

that's when I realized that dreams have

absolutely no boundaries if you learn to

read the signs of life

a more recent story begins four years

ago when Christopher Bailey then head

designer at Burberry and I said in New

York sharing our thoughts of what we

would do if I moved to London to be the

CEO of Burberry my years have taught me

that ensuring alignment of our core

values was a key step prior to

confirmation we talked about creating a

great company the kind of company we

both always dreamed of working for we

chatted about creating the greatest

Democratic luxury brand in the world we

envisioned a company culture with soul

and the ability to communicate that to

consumers and employees alike through

innovative digital strategies we dreamed

of establishing the Burberry foundation

so that we could help less fortunate

young people realize their creative

dreams our first Christmas card we

proudly printed the famous phrase

attributed to Winston Churchill you make

a living by what you get you make a life

by what you give

Burberry's annual report describes the

key business strategies underlying the

company strong financial results during

the first two and a half years but the

deeper secret to the early success was

that six thousand associates worldwide

we're now dreaming the same dream

sharing the same values but then again

his life would have it in 2008 the world

was rocked by this extensive economic

disruption this could have deeply shaken

our team our company but with our core

values as the foundation our dreams so

clear our hearts so connected it was not

a coincidence that Burberry recovered

quickly and more United than before the

crisis so I know I've made it sound easy

if you dream it it will come but I've

learned much too often in London that

there's sunshine and there's rain and

without the dark clouds you don't truly

appreciate the bright beautiful days

every graduating class is confronted

with its individual tests in my case

when I left Ball State in 1981 at the

start of the worst post-war recession on

record prior to this one

and this was also an era in which women

contended for equal status in a

male-dominated workforce you face

difficult environments and the onset of

a digital revolution with all of its

advantages and challenges but remember

individual opportunities are always

present if you have a dream truly know

yourself and focus on the things that

you control back to Kipling's famous

poem if you can meet with triumph and

disaster and treat those two Impostors

just the same so in writing this speech

I've looked backwards to guide you

forward today you've heard a little of

my personal journey along with the

wisdom of poets philosophers proselytize

errs my parents many of them wrote early

in the last century not you dad and I

find their perspective insightful and

invaluable and often missing from

today's headlines as you leave the

comforts comforts of campus and you

enter the real world learn to share your

values your dreams and your heart with

others College is an individual endeavor

where the broader world is a team sport

and the more honest and open you are

about yourself the more you will stand

out and the faster you will connect and

cut through the competitive clutter

school has sharpened your IQ and

rewarded you with a degree today life

will require you to master your EQ which

will reward you with success in its many

expressions so thank you so much again

for the opportunity to speak today as

the commencement speech was never in my

wildest dreams I have been diligently

working alongside you this final

semester our web chat your tweets the

focus on today's message has helped get

me more in tune encouraging you has

inspired me at this light at this stage

of my life's journey and resulted in the

greatest 50th birthday gift I could ever

receive in turn this speech entitled

from the heart is my gift to celebrate

your amazing achievement and I humbly

hope that it inspires you

to dream even larger this is your life's

roadmap conquer your greatest fears

because there's simply a state of mind

and listen with an amplifier to your

heart and faith as these are your

greatest guides and never forget your

core values they could just be your

greatest asset along with your brilliant

ball state education

so congratulations graduates you are now

global citizens and remember the

universal language is not text emailed

or spoken it's felt good luck as you

continued life's amazing adventure and I

looked so forward to reading your

commencement speech someday thank you

you

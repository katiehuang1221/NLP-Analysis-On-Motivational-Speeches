every year

Auburn University sends a new

outstanding pool of graduates into

society

many of these alums become some of the

brightest and blessed employees senior

executives business owners entrepreneurs

leaders in their fields

one such alumnus is with us today as our

commencement speaker Tim Cook graduated

from Auburn in 1982 with a degree in

industrial engineering since that time

his drive and I in ingenuity have led

him to become one of the top executives

in the country chief operating officer

for Apple incorporated Mr Cook has been

on the forefront of this revolutionary

company in an ever-changing industry

impacting the lives of billions of

people across the world graduates I want

to ask you a question how many of you

own or have ever owned an iPad an iPod

and iPhone or an iMac on a hand

the decisions that mr. cook makes as

part of Apple's leadership determines

the success of Apple's worldwide sales

and operations I would say you've made

good decisions mr. Cook he not only

motivates and inspires his fellow

employees but he's been known to show

his auburn pride and spirit around Apple

headquarters Mr Cook has set where you

are sitting today he knows the

importance of a good education and he

believes in giving back to his alma

mater so that future students can also

fulfill their dreams please welcome with

me Auburn's own alumnus Tim Cook

thank you for that nice reception and

Thank You Virginia for that incredible

introduction I thought some of it was

about somebody else but it's a

tremendous honor and a privilege for me

to be here with all of you to be back to

a place that really feels like home to

me and to be back to a place that brings

back so many fond memories Albarn has

played a key role in my life and

continues to mean a lot to me as anyone

who comes in my office at Apple or my

home in Palo Alto instantly discovers I

have so much Albarn memorabilia you

might think it was a California outpost

for jnm or Anders as thrilled as I am to

be here I stand before you knowing that

the lives of many people here and even

more across our state and Beyond are

deeply affected by the tragedy off our

shores I grew up on the Gulf Coast and

my family still lives there and I want

you to know that my thoughts and hopes

are with you also as thrilled as I am to

be here I stand before you with a deep

sense of humility both because of how I

got here and who is here I am where I am

in life because my parents sacrificed

more than they should have because of

teachers professors friends and mentors

who cared more than they had to and

because of Steve Jobs and Apple who have

provided me the opportunity to engage in

truly meaningful work every day for over

12 years and I know that I am offering

words of advice in front of a faculty

who ideas and research positively impact

our lives and I do so in a gathering

where the faculty is complemented by the

hard-won wisdom of so many parents

grandparents and even great-grandparents

that have been a source of incredible

inspiration for today's graduates

so bearing all that in mind I'll share

some personal discoveries with you that

have at least served me well discoveries

based on this most improbable of

journeys that I have been on my most

significant discovery so far in my life

was the result of one single decision my

decision to join Apple working at Apple

was never in any plan that I had

outlined for myself but was without a

doubt the best decision that I ever made

there have been other important

decisions in my life like my decision to

come to Auburn when I was in high school

some teachers advised me to attend all

burn other teachers advised me to attend

the University of Alabama and well like

I said some decisions are pretty obvious

the decision to come to Apple which I

made in early 1998 was not so obvious

since most of you graduates were 10

years old at the time you may not

realize that the Apple in early 1998 was

very different than the Apple of today

in 1998 there was no iPad or iMac or

iPhone there wasn't even an iPod I know

it's hard to imagine life without iPods

while Apple did make Macs the company

had been losing sales for years and was

commonly considered to be on the verge

of extinction only a few months before

I'd accepted the job at Apple Michael

Dell the founder and CEO of Dell

computer was publicly asked what he

would do to fix Apple and he responded

I'd shut it down and give the money back

to the shareholders in making this

statement what distinguished Michael

Dell was only that he had the courage to

say what so many others believed so

Apple was in a very different place than

it is today and my employer at the time

compact computer was the largest

personal computer company in the world

not only was compact performing much

better than Apple it was headquartered

in Texas and therefore closer to Auburn

football any purely rational

consideration of cost and benefits lined

up in compacts favor and the people who

knew me best advised me to stay a

compact one CEO I consulted felt so

strongly about it he told me I would be

a fool to leave compact for Apple in

making the decision to come to Apple I

had to think beyond my training as an

engineer engineers are taught to make

decisions analytically and largely

without emotion when it comes to a

decision between alternatives we

enumerate the cost and benefits and

decide which one is better but there are

times in our lives when the careful

consideration of cost and benefits just

doesn't seem like the right way to make

a decision there are times in all of our

lives when a reliance on gut or

intuition just seems more appropriate

when a particular course of action just

feels right and interestingly I've

discovered it's in facing life's most

important decisions that intuition seems

the most indispensable to getting it

right in turning important decisions

over to intuition one has to give up on

the idea of developing a life plan that

will bear any resemblance to what

ultimately involves intuition is

something that occurs in the moment and

if you were open to it if you listened

to it it has the potential to direct or

redirect you in a way that is best for

you on that day in early 1998 I listened

to my intuition not the left side of my

brain or for that matter even the people

who knew me best it's hard to know why I

listened I'm not even sure I know today

but no more than five minutes into my

initial interview with Steve

I wanted to throw caution and logic to

the wind and join Apple my intuition

already knew that joining Apple was a

once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work

for the creative genius and to be on the

executive team that could resurrect a

great American company if my intuition

had lost the struggle with my left brain

I'm not sure where I would be today but

I'm certain I would not be standing in

front of you this was a surprising

lesson I recall how uncertain I was at

my own commencement about where my life

would lead there was a part of me that

very much wanted to have a 25 year plan

as a guide to live when I went to

business school we even had an exercise

to do a 25 year plan I found mine now 22

years old in preparing for this

commencement address let's just say it

wasn't worth the yellowed paper it was

written on I didn't understand it then

as a young mba student but life has a

habit of throwing you curveballs don't

get me wrong it's good to plan for the

future but if you're like me and you

occasionally want to swing for the

fences you can't count on a predictable

life but even if you can't plan you can

prepare a great batter doesn't know when

the high hanging curveball is going to

come but he knows it will and he can

prepare for what he will do when he gets

it too often people think about

intuition as the same as relying on luck

or faith at least as I see it nothing

could be further from the truth

intuition can tell you that of the doors

that are open to you which one you

should walk through but intuition cannot

prepare you for what's on the other side

of that door along these lines a quote

that has always resonated with me is one

by Abraham Lincoln he says

I will prepare and someday my chance

will come I have always believed this it

was this basic belief that led me to

Auburn to study Industrial Engineering

led me to co-op alternating quarters

while attending Auburn led me to Duke to

study business and led me to accept so

many jobs in assignments there too

numerous to mention in business as in

sports the vast majority of victories

are determined before the beginning of

the game we rarely control the timing of

opportunities but we can control our

preparation I feel Lincoln's quote is

especially appropriate now given the

state of the economy and the worry that

I suspect a number of you must feel I

had the same worry when I graduated in

1982 yes I am prehistoric for the record

but as many of the parents here will

remember the economy then were some

strong similarities to the economy today

the unemployment rate was in the double

digits we didn't have the collapse of

Wall Street banks but we did have the

savings alone crisis I worried as many

of my classmates did what the future

held for them but what was true for

Lincoln was true for those of us who

graduated in 82 and it is true for those

of you graduating today prepare and your

chance will come just as all previous

generations have done you will stand on

the shoulders of the generation that

came before you the generation of mine

and your parents and you will achieve

more and go farther the fact that you

are here now at this great institution

in this great state at this great moment

for both you and your families is a

testament to the fact that your

preparation has begun continue to

prepare yourselves as you have an Auburn

so when your gut tells you this is my

moment

you are without a doubt ready if you are

prepared when the right door opens then

it comes down to just one more thing

make sure that your execution lives up

to your preparation at least for me the

second sentence of the Auburn Creed I

believe in work hard work really

resonate here and have been one of my

core beliefs for as long as I can

remember though the sentiment is a

simple one there's tremendous dignity

and wisdom in these words and they have

stood the test of time as current events

teach us those who try to achieve

success without hard work ultimately

deceive themselves or worse deceive

others I have the good fortune to be

surrounded by some brilliant intuitive

thinkers who create the most elegant and

extraordinary products in the world for

all of us

intuition is not a substitute for

rigorous thinking and hard work it is

simply the lead-in we never take

shortcuts we attend to every detail we

follow where curiosity leads aware that

the journey may be longer but will

ultimately be more worthwhile we take

risks knowing that risks will sometimes

result in failure but without the

possibility of failure there is no

possibility of success we remember

Albert Einstein's words insanity is

doing the same things over and over

again and expecting different results

when you put it all together I know this

intuition is critical in virtually

everything you do but without relentless

preparation and execution it is

meaningless

so those are my discoveries on the

significance of intuition preparation

and hard work for me they give rise to a

simple principle for the most important

decisions in your life trust your

intuition

and then work with everything you have

to prove it right logic probably

dictates that I end my remarks here but

as I've said sometimes logic shouldn't

prevail and so I have one last brief

discovery to share with you I think it

is misleading to talk about success

without also referencing failure I know

of no one who has achieved something

significant without also in their own

lives experiencing their share of

hardship frustration and regret so don't

believe that something in your past

prevents you from doing great work in

the future to all of you who doubt

yourselves I have been there too and

although today I've spent time talking

about a great decision I've made some

that are far from it and like many of

you I've had my share of life's personal

challenges and failures but after many

miles on my journey

I've recognized that each of these

difficult periods of life passes and

with each we exit stronger and wiser the

old saying this too shall pass has

certainly proven true for me and I'm

sure it will apply to anyone who

believes it so paint in your mind the

most grand vision where you want to go

in life

prepare trust in and execute on your

intuition and don't get distracted by

life's potholes congratulations class of

2010 this is your day this is your

moment you've received a first-class

education from a first-class institution

congratulations to your families and

friends who have supported you and as in

Gordan as this day is make sure that you

carry the Auburn spirit with you in the

weeks months and years ahead let your

joy be in your journey not in some

distant goal and regardless of where

your particular journey may lead you

from this moment forward thank you for

allowing me to play a small part in

today War Eagle and Godspeed

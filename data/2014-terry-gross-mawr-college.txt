thank you I want to start by thanking

you for allowing me to share this very

special day with you I was proud when I

was invited to be your commencement

speaker and even prouder not to have

been disinvited

or force to withdraw because of student

protests thanks for that I actually feel

very connected to bryn mawr two years

ago one of the women graduating here was

now is now our Associate Producer for

online media Molly CBS / Sophie I feel

very connected so many of you know me is

the lady you were forced to listen to

you in your parents car or in the

carpool on your way to and from school

every day and here you are on one of the

most important days of your lives for us

to listen to me again and you're

probably wondering so what's she gonna

do today

ask questions that's not gonna work is

it the best thing I can do is share with

you some of my own experiences and hope

that it might be relevant to the

occasion in biographical interviews I

often focus on the period that many of

you have just come through I guess late

teens and early 20s because this is when

a person becomes who or he or she is

it's the period when we gradually will

the adult version of ourselves into

existence in fact I think of college

particularly out-of-town college not as

just a place for higher education but a

place for self transformation as well

when you're growing up your parents your

teachers even your closest friends they

think they know who you are and what to

expect from you but maybe you think

you're not really the person everyone

else thinks you are yet if you start

behaving differently even if you start

dressing in a different way people might

think it's out of character and that

you're being a phony so that you're

trapped but once you leave for college

you leave behind everyone else's

conception of who you are and this can

be liberating you can change how you

look and on a deeper level

you can change aspects of your

personality and develop into the person

you want to be I speak from experience I

was raised in a very structured

goal-oriented middle-class family and

straight through high school I studied

hard and I got really good grades but

that person I was in high school I

didn't want to be that person anymore

when I started college in part because

if I'm being honest I worried that the

new people I was meeting would find that

person boring it was 1968 which I

mentioned because knowing the era might

help make sense of some of the things I

tried beginning with dropping out of

school for a semester in hitchhiking

cross-country with my boyfriend on

returning to school I went to as few

classes as possible and did as little

work as possible I tread on various

personalities I tried becoming a hippie

but being a free spirit proved

impossible for someone as self-conscious

as I was and still am I was briefly part

of a wannabe rural community slept in

tents grew vegetables and attempted to

dig our own well but I mean what was I

thinking I cannot function without flush

toilets and restaurants within walking

distance as ludicrous as some of this

seems to me now it was actually very

liberating all of it helped teach me who

I was by teaching me who I wasn't and

yet I retained certain traits of each of

those people I tried to be because some

of those traits genuinely were me

remember how I said I was determined to

stop being so studious well now when

people want to compliment me on my

interviews they'll say wow you really do

your homework and I mean I do for better

or worse I spend nearly every weekday

night at my desk poring through research

for the following days interviews so it

turns out the studious person I was in

high school the person I thought I bid

farewell on leaving home took her place

beside all the people I tried to remake

myself into in college who you are is

still evolving and you may find that

like me you end up drawing on those

parts of yourself that you once rejected

rejected because they didn't seem cool

enough or interesting enough most of my

guests on fresh air are on the show

because they've been successful in their

given fields but I often find myself

talking with them about the frustrations

and outright failures they've

experienced professionally or in their

private lives and I think this is

because I believe we're shaped by

failures by our weaknesses and setbacks

at least as much as we are by our

successes and in many cases those

failures may make ultimate success

possible I speak from experience when it

comes to frustration self-doubt and even

outright failure I failed miserably at

my first profession which wasn't radio

it was teaching eighth grade English not

that I felt teaching was my calling but

there I was an English major clueless

about what I might do professionally so

I figured I'll be a teacher but I was

completely unprepared for how difficult

it would be I didn't have what it took

to be an authority figure you can tell

from looking at me I was not physically

imposing at five feet tall I had to look

up at my students the taller ones

towered over me there was always chaos

in the classroom when I could get the

kids into the class half the time they

were in the hallway so I knew I wasn't

cut out for teaching so did the

principal and when he fired me after

about six weeks I actually felt relief

something resembling gratitude still it

was a shock to fail so abysmally so

quickly out of college but it turned out

to be the biggest break I ever had

because it enabled me to stumble into

public radio and this sounds like a

cliche but I really believe failure can

be a blessing in disguise I never would

have thought a career in radio was

possible for me when I was growing up in

the 1950s and 60s there were very few

women on radio and broadcasting was only

one of many professions women were

virtually absent from in my neighborhood

most of the women were full-time

homemakers the few who held paying jobs

worked in what were then the only

professions opened to women teaching

nursing secretarial work or they helped

out with their husbands businesses I had

no clue how to break into any profession

other than these but after being forced

out of teaching and then doing temp mark

I asked myself so what do I really want

to do and I realized I wanted to work in

media but but how I mean I was Neera

confident enough Norris

enough to think such a career was

feasible fortunately there was public

radio where women's voices were starting

to be heard I became a volunteer at a

college radio station where just about

everyone on the air was a volunteer

public radio stations were different

than they hardly had any money or

listeners so I was able to learn on the

air without much complaint about how

ridiculously amateurish I sounded which

was a good thing because my voice was

about an octave higher than it is now I

spoke a lot faster than I do now

and I think I sounded like a feminist

Minnie Mouse but it soon became apparent

I'd found my place and once I started

doing radio I came to realize there was

a gap of sorts between the person I was

on the air and the person I was in

private life on the air I am capable of

asking anybody anything but take away

the mic and I can become uncomfortable

self-conscious and insecure in my

personal life I tried to be nice to

people I want them to like me I was

socialized to be accommodating something

I think I share with most women of my

generation and perhaps yours as well but

when I started producing a radio show I

had to learn to say no I have to reject

people who want to be on fresh air but

aren't accomplished or interesting

enough to be on I also need to be

willing to ask guests challenging

questions and to deal with the

consequences if my questions rub them or

some listeners or bloggers the wrong way

I'm telling you all this because I

suspect that many of you are going to

experience a similar dichotomy between

the person you are on the job and the

person you are in private life if that's

okay it's all part of the total you I

hope that you all go on from here to

fulfilling lives and careers just be

aware these might not be the lives or

careers that others envision for you or

that you envision for yourselves right

now and that's okay if I'm any example

College may be a laboratory for

experimentation and self transformation

but commencement leaving the lab and

becoming a full-fledged adult

doesn't mean you're going to stop

growing when I left college I realize

now the only thing I knew for sure was

that I wanted a life different from my

parents remember how I mentioned that

few women in my neighborhood worked

outside the home I wanted a career and I

didn't feel compelled to marry right

away if at all I decided not to have

children and was fortunate in being from

the first generation of American women

who had the effective birth control that

made that choice possible and and the

first generation of women for whom

changing social standards meant that

those of us who reached middle age

without having become mothers would no

longer be regarded with pity I know

I know now that each generation of young

adults and maybe each generation of

young women in particular at least holds

the potential based on their own

experiences and desires to change the

expectations of adult life in some small

or perhaps some sizable way it's your

turn now and based on all you've

accomplished so far all that brought you

here today I'd say you're gonna do great

but what I really want to say most of

all is congratulations thank you

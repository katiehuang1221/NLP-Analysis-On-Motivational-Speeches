thank you thank you thank you thank you

thank you I am first thing I got to tell

you is I don't want to disappoint

anybody but when you get a reception

like this I need to let you all know

that Will Smith is not coming this is

good as this go get right here I will

always also share with you that you get

to all of us you're gonna get to a point

in your life where you have something

called people and these people who work

for you and work with you is their job

to protect you from yourself and what I

mean by that is on days like today

occasions such as this they're gonna

tell you what to say and how to say it

and I will submit to you that when there

comes that day comes in your life and

folks tell you what to say the best

thing for you to do after you take it

into consideration is to take it and go

like this

go like that that's probably and that

felt good that's probably how some of

your professors don't have to reading

your world

and you know what I'm talking about I

know you do I would share with you that

I know perhaps maybe I was not the first

choice to give this address today maybe

I wasn't the second choice but I was the

only one to return your call okay and

out of all the mother folk I was

probably the only one that could get

here on public transportation

some of the mother folk when you see

Bart to summon a mother folk they

probably think you talking about Bart

Simpson our return to call immediately

intercepted because a lot of folks don't

know this but there was a point in time

where being a working single parent with

a 14 month old baby tire on my back that

my son and I slept on this campus so for

me to go from where I was to giving this

address to you today I kind of feel like

it's my graduation to

and it's an honor to be here

before I say another word I want to to

congratulate all the parents the mothers

fathers grandmothers aunties uncles big

brothers big sisters who helped all of

us to get here today because no one is

going to walk across this dais today

alone everybody got here today because

somebody helped them and I want to give

a special shout out to my fellow single

parents to all the fathers who had to be

mothers and all the mothers who had to

be father

because the best thing that ever

happened to us as parents is you guys

and we are so proud of you and I'm gonna

tell you something else I want you to

consider it there was somebody else

who's not here today who helped you get

to where you are I don't know whether

that person was a high school teacher a

counselor or maybe it was someone who

just worked in the school who saw in you

something that maybe at some point you

didn't see in yourself and I want to ask

you today to reach out to that person

don't call them go seal don't email them

and whatever you do do not Twitter

tweets or whatever that stuff is all

right

don't do it go see them shake their

hands hug them laugh with them cry with

them and say thank you and to all the

folks who said you couldn't do it so all

the folks who said you wouldn't make it

you are perfectly justified to say how

you like me now

as a member of the class of 2009

graduates of UC Berkeley I asked myself

when I was trying to compose my thoughts

what would I want to hear from someone

today what I want to hear more about the

state of the economy Wall Street

bailouts of the job market know I would

like to hear from someone that you know

what amidst all this chaos and

turbulence there's an opportunity to

create a new vision of the American

dream that's what I would like to give

you somebody today our new vision of the

American dream as great as any of the

visions and dreams of our forefathers

founding fathers and ancestors a new

vision of the American Dream that says

achieving balance in your life is more

important than the balance in your

checking account our new vision illumine

vision of the Americans rainwear

appreciation is greater than expectation

a new vision that says for too long a

lot of us been living in exile and a

place called things and it's time for us

to come home to friends families and

folks

I submit to you today that this new

vision of the American Dream means that

what you do does not define who you are

a new vision that says do not confuse

your net worth with your self-worth a

new vision that says hey stuff toys and

things exist but they are not necessary

for you to be happy this vision I submit

firmly rooted in the past appreciative

of today but clearly focused on the

future that we can choose to create and

my last words to you today will be this

a lot of other folk will tell you that

the sky has fallen I will not say that

to you I will not tell you that the sky

has fallen I will say that those are

pennies from heaven you know why I say

that because I've seen this movie before

and I know how it turns out and the last

pin pick the last thing I will say to

you today is is all of my fellow

classmates all my fellow classmates and

graduates you are in a position to go

forward and I encourage you that

whatever you do for the rest of your

life always pursue happiness and you can

start where you are thank you so much

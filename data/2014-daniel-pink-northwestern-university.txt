Thank You president Shapiro

Dean Mangelsdorf trustees karda Haas and

Finley socio Dean's faculty

distinguished guests thank you for this

high honor and great privilege Wow look

at all of you it's been a long four

years hasn't it

some of you didn't think you'd make it

here many of you have no idea what's

going to happen next but still here you

are sitting in hard seats baking in the

Sun and nursing a wicked hangover

but enough about you parents I'm here to

talk to the students the proud and

mighty class of 2014 today I want to

tell you a story about something I

learned one afternoon my senior year at

Northwestern it's an insight that has

shaped my life and that might be helpful

in yours as Sarah mentioned 28 years ago

I graduated from the College of Arts and

Sciences with a degree in linguistics

and all of the job prospects attached

thereto 1986 was an exciting year for

the nu linguistics department we

graduated a record number of students

there were four of us now when you major

in linguistics or art history or

classics or god forbid anthropology

[Applause]

people always ask you the same question

you got it what are you gonna do with

that what are you gonna do with that now

I know that ever since childhood you've

been told there's no such thing as a

stupid question well that's a stupid

question

and if you get it this weekend and I'm

looking at you Slavic languages and

literature Department just respond with

a brief you never know because you never

know which leads to my story I took lots

of excellent classes here during my four

years at Northwestern and among the best

were several small seminars I took in

the college's amazing writing program I

took what was then called writing the

short story with the wonderful Sheila

Schwartz who taught us how to use

mundane details to

reveal cosmic truths I took writing

poetry with the legendary South African

poet Denis Brutus who told me he'd give

me an a-minus in the course if I promise

never to write poetry again and best of

all in the spring of my senior year I

took writing the essay with a young and

brilliant instructor named Charlie yarn

off who still teaches that in you you

know happens to be sitting here today

now I already knew how to write an essay

of course like many of you I grew up in

the American Midwest in Columbus Ohio

Wow a bunch of people have obviously

never been to Columbus and back in

central Ohio we learned how it was done

so when I logged my 25 pound electric

typewriter up the stairs to the third

floor of Bob Hall my freshman year yeah

I had essay writing pretty much down

figure out your thesis make an outline

execute against that outline build your

essay like you build a house thesis

outline execution in like all of you

I've gotten pretty good at it

but I wanted to get better and I figured

this guy yaar enough might help alas

alas on one of our very first essay

assignments I found myself struggling my

thesis was soggy and bland Part A of the

essay wobbled like the lime jell-o they

used to serve for dessert at sergeant

Hall Part B was a six car pileup of

cliches and platitudes

Part C well part C was blank

so on the day before our essay was due I

dragged myself to class

filled with dread and self-loathing I

explained my predicament and began

frantically suggesting ways to repair my

crumbling house maybe I should tighten

the thesis

maybe my outline should have four parts

instead of three maybe it wasn't as

awful as I thought and I should just

power through and finish the job

Charlie Arnoff didn't agree with any of

my suggestions no he told me your

problem is something else you don't know

what you think and then he unleashed

nine words that changed my life

dan he said sometimes you have to write

to figure it out sometimes you have to

write to figure it out I was stunned

this went against most of my previous

instruction and much of what I thought

this country stood for wait a second

that's allowed you didn't have to know

exactly what you wanted to say before

you tried to say it

writing wasn't only a way to memorialize

your thinking it was a way to figure out

what you actually thought now today from

the vantage point of someone who's been

on the planet for nearly 50 years and

who spent many many of those years

writing for a living

that's this insight no longer seem so

remarkable but to twenty-one-year-old me

it was a revelation

sometimes you have to write to figure it

out

this was huge this is liberating this

was a little scary I took the advice

back to my creaky apartment on the

corner of Clark Street and Sherman

Avenue which sat above what was then the

Sherman snack shop in what today like

much of America is probably a Panera and

since that spring day I've carried

Charlie's words with me when I'm sitting

at the computer trying to do my job and

the cursor just blinks and blinks and

blinks

me for my incompetence and incoherence a

many many times say to myself Dan

sometimes you have to write to figure it

out now if that were all I got out of

this senior year encounter indeed if

that were all I got out of Northwestern

that alone might have been enough to

justify all those student loans and

work-study jobs but what I didn't

realize then is that this advice wasn't

just savvy guidance for how to write it

might be the wisest advice I know for

how to live let me explain every one of

you seniors today

is thinking about obviously about the

rest of your life and many of you are

thinking about it in a systemic thesis

outline execution sort of way you've

come up with a perfectly formulated aim

you've outlined the precise steps that

will get you there and now once your

diploma is in hand you'll move to the

execution phase sound familiar

econ majors and if you're not thinking

this way your parents probably wish you

were they love you they worry about you

how you'll deal with the possibility of

massive debt and minimal job options

they want you to be okay and the way to

be okay we all believe is to have a

specific plan except maybe it's not

sometime before graduation ends try this

experiment for me find someone in his or

her 40s 50s or 60s who's doing something

you admire something that contributes to

the world something that you might like

to do yourself one day then ask that

person how they got there I guarantee

you 97 times out of 100 the smartest

most interesting most dynamic most

impactful people will answer that

question like this it's a long story

why because they lived to figure it out

at some point in their lives they

realize that carefully crafted plans

like meticulously outlined essays often

don't hold up and tweaking the topic

sentences or rearranging the subsections

isn't enough sometimes the only way to

discover who you are or what life you

should lead is to do less planning and

more living to burst the double bubble

of comfort and convention and just do

stuff even if you don't know precisely

where it's going to lead because you

don't know precisely where it's going to

lead now this might sound risky and you

know what it is it's really risky but

the greater risk is to choose false

certainty over genuine ambiguity the

greater risk is to fear failure more

than mediocrity the greater risk is to

pursue a path only because it's the

first path you decided to pursue that's

why I have so many extraordinary

northwestern friends and classmates who

are doing things they never envisioned

when they sat in your seats long ago a

material science major who ended up as a

furniture maker a scary smart economics

major who dropped out of law school to

teach fiction a political science major

who twenty years later was elected

Commissioner of the World Series of

Poker even even a nerdy guy from

Columbus Ohio who thought he'd become a

lawyer and maybe a congressman but who

ended up thrilled beyond measure to be

working out of a garage writing books

they we lived to figure it out and this

is much less frightening than it seems

believe me on this as Sarah mentioned

nine years after graduating from

Northwestern I had the good fortune of

working in the White House I got my job

the old-fashioned Washington way

the first choice imploded in a scandal I

was nervous

until I read something that peggy noonan

a speechwriter for President Ronald

Reagan once wrote she said she had a

three-stage reaction to working in the

White House in stage one she took the

job arrived on her first day and thought

I hope nobody realizes how stupid I am

in stage two a couple of months later

she realized hey I'm as smart as anyone

here and in stage three after a few more

months she looked around and said oh my

god we're in charge mark my words

then ask your parents oh my god we're in

charge

we'll be the central recurring

experience of your adult life

so so fear not my soon-to-be fellow

alumni if you don't know what you're

doing that makes you roughly as

competent as everyone else out there and

if you unlike so many of them are

willing to throw away the outline when

it no longer makes sense to harness the

wisdom of Charlie yarn off to live to

figure it out you can do great things

thank you Godspeed and congratulations

to the amazing astounding or inspiring

Weinberg college of Arts and Sciences

class of 2014

Thank You Daniel that was terrific

I'm feeling a lot of love for the folks

in the front you may notice that my lips

aren't quite synced up with what I'm

saying

that's because given my little

reputation as somewhat of a loose cannon

amongst the faculty they've decided to

put my speech on a time delay

conveniently had anything out that your

sensitive ears may not want to hear but

you know I wrote a pretty tame speech so

I think it shouldn't be too much of a

big deal let me start by saying that

shoes should have taken the beta blocker

I have a backup speech here last night

this made this made you um wear shoe

covers

this is the most crucial piece of advice

the hospital is a dangerous place with

more expensive shoes

and we are tired of buying you new ones

love dad

at 26 years old I have been through what

feels like two lifetime's worth of

experience so I can stand here today and

who would have imagined that I would

make it this far

it's certainly not my parole oh and

probably got me in the next few minutes

join me if you will on a journey through

medical school as I experienced it

colleges in advance to the faculty

let me start with little spiel about

myself you see I have been surrounded by

medicine since I was a little baby boy

because both of my parents are

physicians in fact my mother is a

psychiatrist which explains a lot

when I told her I wanted to go to

medical school

she sat me down she smiled at me she

gave me a big psychiatric hug and then

she proceeded to ground me for three

days of course it was only after

finishing medical school that I realized

that this was actually a 72-hour

involuntary psychiatric be a danger to

others ironically having gone through

the whole process now I realized that in

retrospect that in medicine we can

become so obsessed with avoiding being a

danger to others that we ultimately

become a danger to ourselves and in the

end end up gravely disabled and so with

this knowledge I began the first year of

medical school one realizes shortly

after entering UCSF that med school is a

lot like one of those cheesy Las Vegas

buffets

bear with me

deceptively chief all right you're going

to be paying later at the casino ever

heard of residency the line to get in is

super long and it's filled with some of

the more interesting characters you need

once you get in you're immediately over

won by all the few choices you know you

can't possibly eat this all and you try

and you end up so stuff that you

couldn't possibly hold in another bite

but in a few days you realize it's all

good because medical school is all about

regurgitation

you're busy memorizing so much stuff

that your normal life of ferrets are

displaced from your brain and you know

you're in trouble and you'll have done

this don't try to lie to me when you

make up a mnemonic to remember your

family members names but ultimately the

doors to about two years of medical

school are pretty easy right until you

realize that you have to study for and

task that behemoth of standardized exams

the National bullets episode clean the

boss earlier mentioned quote by Winston

Churchill I would like to also court

quote Churchill with regard to the war

with the boards never before have so

many that know so little about so much

[Applause]

and you know you've studied wouldn't

think too much when your mom calls you

and ask you if you're tired if you need

anything if you want to talk to Aunt

Marge and you go be both one then

there's the third year it was the best

of times it was the worst of times how

the times I was like a deer in the

headlights I became so pervaded with

medical culture that when my girlfriend

asks me how I was I would respond soon

and ammonia is a 25

dehydration secondary to chronic

bilateral lacrimal hypersecretion

families I was crying like a little baby

let's relive some of the highlights of

30 rotations or shall we

surgery intellectual boot camp names of

famous long dead surgeons while holding

retractor during a five-hour operation

internal medicine forget the five-hour

operation yuk it up for six hours on

medicine rounds grill as unanimously

discuss the finer aspects of Gow

Pediatrics although seemingly

complicated Pediatrics can be reduced to

a simple equation screaming baby squared

plus irate parents over airborne illness

equals alternative career plan

[Applause]

psychiatry I'm sorry

[Music]

takes about a week to realize that that

babbling incoherent patient hiding under

the desk is your president

you learn you learn a lot during

rotation you learn that really the only

difference between you and your patients

is that your patients are properly

medicated

[Music]

neurology

not gonna touch it Dan Lowenstein has

been known to crush people with his mind

[Applause]

obstetrics and gynaecology two words

shoe covers

anyways moving on the fourth year rules

it's easy like Sunday morning once again

you feel like you want to break into

song but and I think medical school was

designed that way with a purpose to make

us feel good when we leave and I'm

feeling good it's one my friends asked

you know my friends wanted medicine the

few that are left would you do it all

again I think the answer is really quite

obvious absolutely not allow me to

qualify I wouldn't do it twice but I

wouldn't not do it once you see the

experiences that I've had in medical

school and the way that I've grown as a

person and the human connections that

I've had the honor to make with my

patients and with my colleagues and with

my mentors these things I wouldn't trade

for anything in the world and as we go

our separate ways here tonight we have

to realize that unless we care for

ourselves and we care for each other as

professionals and his friends we can't

hope to retain the humanity to give our

patients the care that they deserve a

little bit of empathy

a little bit of humor go such a long way

in our profession and whatever you do

don't forget the shoe covers thank you

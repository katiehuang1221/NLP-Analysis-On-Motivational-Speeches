what's up dragons alright let's start

with how grateful I am

I met John Frye at an Eagles game before

we were the Super Bowl champs what a

thing Trachsel as a community I want to

check thank the trustees and I and I

understand there's like 20 to 25

thousand people here I want to thank all

of you for coming here didn't let me be

your speaker today it's quite an honor

actually came here guys to ask you a

question how many of you gonna change

the world now ideally all of you would

have stood up and would have yelled and

screamed and cheered and chilled this

damn Stadium for those of you don't know

me I'm a filmmaker I was born in India

and I spent my whole life here in

Philadelphia and I'm gonna tell you two

versions of my life so far both equally

true this is an attempt to be real for a

second with each other this is gonna be

a really unusual like commencement

speech well he was the first version

went to NYU film school and two

scholarships graduated in a little over

three years made my first film at 21

making me one of the youngest

professional filmmakers in history sold

an original script in one of the biggest

bidding wars of the time and then went

on to be a writer on three films that

went on to be the three biggest films of

that year for three Studios one of them

was a sixth sense

I wrote a 25 directed at 27 went on to

one to become one of the biggest films

of all time wrote and directed non-stop

from then till now culminating in over

three billion dollars in the theaters

most of which came from an original

movies out of my head word for word I

could I could argue that I am the

highest paid writer in the world I've

been offered every franchise film you

can imagine everything I've ever written

since puberty has been offered to be

made into a film my films have opened

number one in every country in the world

countless times most likely every adult

in this stadium has seen one of my films

most likely every one of these adults

has given me money I have never had a

job other than a filmmaker I walk into a

room with other filmmakers and the word

I hear most often his honor it's an

honor to meet you

I mean artists from around the world and

they say you are an icon so now here's

the second version of my career made a

film at 21 it was pulled from one

theater in two weeks made a second film

that was pulled from a handful of

theaters in a couple weeks the second

film was reviewed by major reviewers and

despised two-time failure 24 living in

my parents guestroom with my new wife

sold a script to Fox and was immediately

fired by them as the director show my

film is sick sense to people no one

thinks it will work dumps to get to

dumped in the worst released time of the

year back then make a few hit films in a

row then make a film that Newsweek calls

the worst film of the year when

countless awards for failure and lack of

talent as the years go by there was an

Internet blog mocking me and raising

money to send me back to film school

there is hatred from critics and

bloggers alike I make children's films

that get roasted and fail have a press

screening of a film that I love and in

the middle of the press screening a

person stands up and says this film

sucks never happened before or after a

studios computer gets hacked in those

hacks there are released emails that say

they don't believe in me and wouldn't

hire me find myself questioning myself

every thought that comes out of my head

the world of my industry has decided I

have no worth I am a cautionary tale a

person who got lucky for a time but

revealed himself to be a sham I make an

independent film that I pay for and

every single studio passes I am on the

verge of financial collapse

I do not believe in myself how do we

explain these two versions of a life how

does this all make sense you know it did

make sense to me and I can go back and

understand it all because there was a

principle at work and I didn't see it I

was incredibly powerful at every step of

the way

and I didn't see it I am here to put

forth the theory that every one of you

is insanely powerful and don't know it

let me tell you the moment kind of this

all started to make sense to me

so I told you I decided to pay for a

film write this independent film well I

took a loan against our house and this

was kind of a time when nobody was

calling nobody wanted to make a film

with me so I don't know this was out of

courage or just desperation but I took a

loan against our house and I made a film

without anybody's permission so I went

to shot the movie and six weeks after I

finished it I was so nervous about what

I'd done I wanted to show the film

studios the movie to get one of them to

buy it so I would know I'd be safe

before I finished the film I flew out to

Los Angeles and I showed it to every

studio everyone passed now passed means

they're not interested that's kind of a

industry term I flew home in a daze I

was going to lose millions and have to

sell the movie to video-on-demand and no

one would see it and the world would

know I'd made a film that was

unreleasable I came home into my house

and I saw my family I was really quiet

obviously I was in the days and my

youngest daughter who's here somewhere

was in the in the dining room and there

was a puzzle box there that she wanted

to do that we were given and I promised

her we would do this puzzle and I just

standing there in a daze and I was like

you want to do the puzzle I asked her

softly and she said yeah she was really

excited so we opened up the puzzle box

dumped all the pieces thousand pieces on

the dining table when we started the

puzzle and we took like you know ten

minutes 15 minutes and looked and tried

to find the shape and we found two

pieces that fit together and then we

spent another like 15 minutes and we

found a second piece you know two

to put it together another one and I was

like this is impossible this is just

impossible and we spend another 10 15

minutes and found another piece and

another 10 15 minutes and found another

piece and another and another and we're

about like two hours in now and we have

like 8 to 10 pieces and we're ecstatic

and we feel so accomplished and excited

and it hits me it all suddenly felt so

so simple why did we keep looking for

another piece why didn't we just stop

why didn't we give up how do we find

those 8 to 10 pieces because we knew

there was a picture it's right there on

the box it's right there and then it

kind of kind of I mean I literally

remember this moment in the dining room

I it all felt suddenly so simple

intensely simple and right I don't need

to know what the picture is of my life I

just have to trust there is a picture

find the next next puzzle piece and

trust don't try to figure out the

picture don't try to fight all the

pieces at once find one piece trust the

rest I felt relief and more to the point

I felt powerful so I went into the

editing room the next day and I just

made one scene better just one moment

better and I just concentrated you know

try to different take you know move the

line a little bit tried a different you

know sound effect here made that moment

better then I made another moment better

and another moment better and another

moment better and I just stopped

thinking about selling the movie I

stopped thinking about what was gonna

happen to me and I just got addicted

this feeling of finding that that next

thing making that next thing better and

I just did that day after day after day

after day and then when I was almost

done I was like I want I Know Who I want

to show - there was one studio that said

they wouldn't mind seeing it when it was

done and so when I finished it we went

to a movie theater in Los Angeles and I

asked this one studio to come out there

we showed them the movie in front of an

audience the audience went crazy they

bought the movie that movie was the

visit was bought by the Universal

Pictures and

went on to become one of the biggest

independent movies of that year and it

costs five million dollars thank you

and it made it made a hundred million

dollars and I owned it and then I paid

for my next film split and that cost

nine million dollars and that grows two

hundred and eighty million dollars and

then I just paid for the next movie

glass I tried to make sense of all of

this but I just told you guys what was I

feeling at the puzzle why did I feel so

powerful and how did that manifest into

reality in the real world how is it

sometimes in life I felt powerful and

sometimes not how was I getting these

conflicting signals how come the system

held me in place where it wanted to and

other times I could do what I wanted

then I came across this philosopher

Epictetus epictetus is a Greek

philosopher about 2,000 years ago and in

his book called a hamburger he talks

about to you how the universe works

to believe Epictetus his philosophy you

have to believe one thing you have to

believe the universe is fundamentally

benevolent fundamentally good this is

just something you just gotta you just

gotta accept in your DNA in your bones

he delineate it delineates between those

things that we have power over and those

things the universe has power over at

any moment in our lives we have control

over countless things including our

thoughts and that is enough when we try

to put a control or put our energy into

those things the universe has control

over it will back and you and teach you

otherwise it is in this dynamic that we

get confused where we start to feel

falsely powerless if you write a song

put all your energy in the emotion and

the craft of writing the song spend no

energy on how it will be received after

that that's the universe's job it may

want you to fail on your first few

albums but let you find the exact right

writing partner that lets you dig deeper

and find that point of view that will

change the world it is none of your

concern how the universe helps you you

just have to believe

the universe is moving on your behalf to

let you grow and give you countless

opportunities to do what you are doing

you got fired in the field that you love

there was a reason one that will help

you what do you have control over at

that moment that is enough

a person who concentrates on what they

have power over becomes unlimited in

their ability to manifest what they want

in the world what do you have control

over and leave the rest of the control

of the universe it's on your side don't

try to get involved in its business

you're gonna get smacked this kind of

dovetails with my belief that we are

powerful antennas and whatever we are

concentrating on and doing draws like

things this is all probably physics

actually the movement of energy and we

call it the universe and some people

call it God we are extremely powerful I

wanna give you a couple little anecdotes

a couple of stories one is actually from

a friend of mine Frank Marshall who's a

producer I did not ask his permission to

tell the story so he men kept saying but

when he was younger he was in Italy and

he was working on a film he was an

associate producer working on a film for

a director named Peter Bogdanovich and

this was a long time ago and it was in

Italy and they were having lunch and a

young filmmaker named Steven Spielberg

came to visit the sets and they sat down

he told me the story they sat down for

the lunch and Peter Bogdanovich the

director said hey can you fix that X why

did you guys take care of that XYZ

problem I'm really worried about this

and Frank sat down at the table and all

the pasta was laid out for everybody and

he just got up and said I'm gonna take

care of this right now and he left and

Steven Spielberg saw that Frank got up

and didn't eat his pasta and this little

moment stuck in Stevens head and goes he

thought to himself gosh I mean I want

somebody like that helping me make my

movies fast forward to a beach many many

many years ago

later and George Lucas and Steven

Spielberg are talking about making a

movie and Steven set and Steven says I'm

gonna direct James Bond and and then

George Lucas says no no I got a better

character he's an archaeologist tells

him the story and Stevens like I'm in

I'm and I'll direct it and then they say

well who should produce it and then

Steven says oh whoa this

a long time ago I'm gonna check out and

see where he is so he calls up Frank

Marshall and asked him to be the

producer of Raiders of the Lost Ark and

Frank goes on to become one of the most

prolific producers of all time including

producing three of my movies does does

literally does Stephen remember this man

if he isn't entirely about the things

that are important to him if he

literally eats that pasta does he not

become the biggest producer of all time

and I think about that story a lot I'm

gonna tell you another one

1961 in Dartford England there's a

seventeen year old boy he's obsessed

with American blues in specific Chicago

blues man spends all his time on the

listening the radio and trying to find

these American records you know which

were hard to find in London at that time

all he does is think about blues and

music and plays guitar so one day he's

sitting at a train station and he sees

another kid around his age waiting for

the train this kid that's standing there

and waiting for the train is holding a

Chuck Berry album and a Muddy Waters

album the 17 year old sitting down gets

up goes over to this kid and says how

did you how do you get these albums what

what how did you do this what why are

you all these albums and the two kids

start talking to kids only the album

says oh I know a record the place that

has these and Ungar an underground place

let's go they talk about blues and all

that stuff the boy on the bench at the

train station is Keith Richards maybe

the greatest rock and roll guitarists of

all time and the boy with the records is

Mick Jagger maybe the greatest rock and

roll lead singer of all time they go on

very soon after that meeting to create

the Rolling Stones

so was that luck he's a god who's Keith

Richards concentrating so much on what

he got control over that he noticed what

the boy was holding he could have easily

been looking at the pretty woman that

was waiting for the train or the dad who

was yelling at the son or he could he

could have been staring at nothing

whatever he was focused on was there to

be seen did the universe bring the

greatest rock n roll singer to the train

station of the exact right moment with

those albums did the universe make sure

he was holding it in his left hand and

not his right hand

and for you critics out there was it

just luck but see this kind of stuff

keeps happening to me over and over and

over the exact right thing I need to see

her have happen happens when I'm focused

with clarity like an antenna like we all

are I concentrated on a character that

can play 24 personalities one's a child

one's a woman has to be scary has to be

beautiful he has to be yes it has to

make us root for him and literally James

McAvoy bumps into me at an event I've

never met the man

he could have walked around the tables

going to a bar and he could have he

could have gone that way went two feet

this way and he came and bumped into me

and as soon as I met him I'm like this

is the guy and he gave an extraordinary

performance and I'm not sure if anybody

could have played that part except that

one man that bumped into me and I'd

never met him before

happens over and over and over to me

what I'm saying is really hard to hold

on to I get that it's really hard to

when you're trying to believe you have

something worthy to contribute you will

face stages as the system tries to like

you know hold you back a bit it'll start

with your your voice is not worthy then

you just keep fighting you'll get to the

next stage which is hey man your voice

is just not relatable then you get to

the next stage if you keep pushing

through hey maybe there's something

there we can guide if you start

listening to the system enough then you

keep pushing forward and you get to

whatever's working in your voice is not

sustainable it's a fluke and then you

keep working and you keep concentrating

the things you have control over and you

get to hey yeah your voice is great

we're gonna put it in the system and the

system changes the same thing goes on

with my original movies it starts out

like it's always the same this is

terrible this is a mess then the next as

you work on it and work on it work on it

then it's like oh this has a ton of

problems it's too weird and then it

graduates - hey parts of it work then it

goes - it's pretty good but X Y Z

expected thing is better and then it

finally goes - I knew that was great all

along many times I've stopped at one of

these stages and agreed other times I've

powered through to my own truth like the

visit with the puzzle pieces which

remind me where my power is I've a slate

from powerful to powerless how pathetic

and inspiring I am just vacillating back

and forth in equal measures

the system has pre-programmed me to

believe the prior it's why our

basketball players missed their open

shots they don't realize they're in

complete control of the outcome and

believe they might be powerless and the

circumstances will prove that you can

you can see it as they're taking that

shot when it goes from the things they

have the control over to wondering what

will happen which is the universe's job

it's why we shove away someone we love

and we're getting intimate with we feel

the need to protect ourselves because

we're not in control of the outcome and

we'll get hurt by what the universe

sends us our fear of what we have power

over our actions our gestures our words

our thoughts isn't enough we grab for

what the universe has control over and

here's the strange part we are all

bizarrely scared of our own power every

time we feel it we shut down start

fearing it isn't true waiting for

something bad to happen to disprove what

we just experienced this leads to

destructive postures and actions and

more to the point we put our energy into

the things the universe has control over

and feel powerless and the cycle spirals

I can feel it in me when I'm worrying

about the reaction to the ideas I have

versus working on the execution of those

same ideas we keep wanting to make sure

the outcome is what we want just trust

the universe is on our side my wife and

I my wife dr. Bob neshama and I have a

foundation the am night Shyamalan

foundation we have leaders around the

world that moved their communities

forward despite impossible odds

we support individuals that concentrate

on what they have control over and do

seemingly impossible things in hopeless

situations you guys might think hey man

you know you're older I'll figure this

out when I get older you know though I'm

down the road a bit well let's look at a

group of people that are before you

actually I'm particularly interested in

the achievement gap in America where my

education graduates where they

how many of you the rest of you know

what this is the education got the

achievement gap this is the gap between

low-income inner-city schools which are

98% African American and Hispanic and

their white suburban counterparts and

this has existed forever and continues

to to this day and it drives me crazy I

wrote a book called I got schooled a few

years ago based on our research our

foundation did by scouring education

studies the United States over the last

25 years I went in there thinking and

looking for why these schools were bad

and what I found out there's nothing

wrong with these schools the data was

really clear if you really look at it

it's outside the schools that there is a

problem those kids walk in there with a

belief system so strong that we created

basically the data says America is

racist

those kids are being whispered to and

yelled at in every form from movies to

what stores are on their block to images

they see to their friends and loved ones

attitudes from their own experiences

they have everyone is telling them the

same message it's country is not for you

you are worthless you don't matter you

are powerless the things that data shows

close the achievement gap are all

related to belief systems and the

dissemination of those new beliefs did

you know that two-thirds of the entire

achievement gap between low-income

inner-city kids that are black and

Hispanic and their white suburban

counterparts happens in the summer you

heard me right

if there was a kid in the inner-city

low-income school and there's a white

suburban kid and they're at the same

level in June when they come back in

September the white suburban kid is one

month ahead and that low-income

inner-city kid is three months behind in

September they're four months apart

they don't even they don't even look

like the same students and after beep

that and that happens because they're

getting pummeled by subtle and not

subtle messaging that tells them that

they are useless and they believe it

summer after summer it builds and

separates these two children and they

don't even look comparable the tenants

of the principles that close the

achievement gap

close it by screaming a culture of

empowerment so loud it's louder than the

racist message we see shout to them when

they are out of school and these kids

close the gap in fact they can

outperform the white suburban kids we

have one leader

Alejandro Daugherty guys that works with

kids and families for five weeks over

the summer and achieves a three month

reading game that stays with them

throughout the school year if you do in

the math they are six months ahead of

their other inner-city low-income peers

and two months ahead of their white

suburban counterparts these kids that

are closing the gap are and creating a

gap the other way are being taught to

concentrate on those things they have

control over unlearning the helplessness

that was injected into their DNA by a

country that was built with the sin of

slavery in its veins what I believe is

that this is a direct line from 300

years ago to the achievement gap a

belief system

why didn't every single one of the 2018

graduating class stand up and roar and

cheer when I asked them what was going

that if they were going to change the

world the banality of life sometimes

lulls us into believing there isn't this

matrix like power over the world that we

are this powerful that those that stand

before you like myself have some magic

power you know I didn't come here to

advise you

I came here to demand you stop

pretending and leave me the system

tricks us into thinking we are powerless

and the system will give us power when

it deems fit but here's the amazing

thing the system is made up caps the

gowns were wearing the chairs

everything's made up art the the length

of a record was you know that song is

made by the size of the record seatbelts

not being on buses bands leaving the

stage and coming back for an encore the

dairy industry is good for you we don't

know how to make electric cars the laws

the electoral system based on protecting

those states with slaves it's all made

up why not you why did you buy into this

garbage that you are not the creators of

this world

when you when did you turn into those

little inner-city african-american and

Spanish kids who believe they are not

smart when did you start on the journey

to be like me

and vacillate and discredit truth as it

happens to me

when did you abdicate your power to

starts and start secretly cursing the

universe I didn't come here to lecture

you and say be like me I came here to

say bet to say be better than me be way

better than me we've all been told the

lie it's what kept you in those damn

seats that someone else decided the

width and the depth and the curve of and

by the way it's bad for you someone else

decided how you were going to sit and

you know what happens when when you

don't realize your power a wannabe

artist gets rejected from art school and

convinces an entire country to kill

Jewish people skewer babies on tree

limbs a megalomaniac can subvert a

planet and human rights in the name of

protecting an antiquated idea of America

a person can walk into a school and

shoot children these people feel

powerless and they find power by showing

the illusion of the system feel in some

perverted way powerful by exposing the

same line it's not healthy for any one

of us to not feel powerful it's not

healthy for Humanity I didn't come here

to lecture you I came here to yell at

you you can't sit in your damn seats you

haven't succeeded at the highest level

graduating from one of the finest

institutions in the world by doing what

everyone told you to do in the way they

told you to do it now stop it

we don't need another 6,000 souls going

on in the world thinking they are

powerless unless they succeed at a

system that was laid out for them before

them I don't accept you are too young to

know better I don't accept your

passivity I don't accept your fears you

have told yourself there's enough people

graduating today in this stadium just

this place to change everything period

every law every medical practice every

art form every way our society relates

how we treat the mentally ill

we treat those that don't look like us

you are powerful beyond your wildest

dreams right now

Epictetus was right the universe is just

waiting for you waiting and listening

waiting for you to say something now I'm

gonna ask you again one last time and

you better answer it right because I

have three daughters and you're

responsible for them from this point on

you're responsible for all our sons and

daughters class of 2018 how many of you

are going to change the world thank you

for listening my theory of you guys

[Applause]

that that wasn't a commencement speech

that was a gift take that gift and work

with it

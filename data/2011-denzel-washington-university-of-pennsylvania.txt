thank you thank you very much

I am obviously the most unorganized

everybody else has nice boxes bring

their script up in and I just like kind

of got it all my stuff here we put it

inside of a magazine so so in fact I

don't even have it in the right order

wait a minute let me get in the right

order here so if it starts like flying

around the stage just you know run

around and grab it for me and bring it

back up here for me I'll keep going as I

can

president Gutmann Provost price board

chair cohen fellow honorees beautiful

honorees and today's graduates um I'm

honored and grateful for the invitation

today I'm it's always been great to be

on the Penn campus I've been here before

a lot of times for basketball games my

son played at the Palestra played on the

basketball team I yeah that's right

played on the basketball team coach

didn't give me enough playing time we'll

talk about that later

no I'm really are I really pleased with

the progress that Coach Allen has made

and no I do I am I really am and I hope

I'm the best success in the future and

you know I always get a warm welcome

when I come to Pennsylvania when I come

to Philadelphia except on the few

occasions where I wear my Yankee cap

what's wrong with that III can't

suddenly just switch up and wear a

Philly cap I mean and I mean it's like

taking your life in your hands around

here when you were a Yankee cap I'm

telling you I met a couple of guys and

they were like hey we love you Denzel

but you know you're walking around with

that hat on we don't care who you are so

you be happy to see that I'm not wearing

my Yankee cap today I'm wearing my

Yankee socks my Yankee t-shirt my Yankee

jock shorts and yaki underwear my Yankee

toe warmers but it's not my Yankee cap

but still I'll be honest with you I'm

I'm a little nervous I'm not used to

speaking at a graduation of this

magnitude it's a little overwhelming

it's out of my comfort zone

now you dressed me up in army fatigues

or throwing me on top of a moving train

someone said unstoppable or asked me to

play mile for max Rubin hurricane Carter

or Alonzo from training day I can do

that but the commencement speech it's

it's very serious affair and it's a very

different ballgame there are literally

thousands and thousands of people here

and for those who say well you're a

movie star millions of people watch you

and watch you speak all the time well

that's - that that's a trek technically

true but I'm not actually in the theater

watching them watching me

I think that makes sense I mean I'm not

there when they call for a fidget around

or pull out their iPhones or tech boy

friend or scratch their behinds or

whatever it is they're doing in the

movie theater but from up here I can see

every single one of you and that makes

me uncomfortable so please don't pull

out your iPhone's and your text don't

text your boyfriend until after I'm done

please if you have to scratch it behind

I mean I understand go ahead I was

thinking about this speech what I should

say I figured the best way to keep your

attention would be to talk about

something you know really like juicy

Hollywood stuff like I thought I could

talk about me and Russell Crowe getting

in arguments on a set of American

Gangster or but I said now now now

you're a group of high-minded

intellectuals you're not interested in

that

yeah oh maybe not I thought about a

private moment I had backstage with

Angelina Jolie in a dressing room after

the Oscars but I said no I don't think

so this is an Ivy League school and I

mean Angelina Jolie half naked in a

dressing room who wants to hear about

that no one no one no one no one this is

Penn that stuff would never go over well

over here maybe a Drexel but not over

whoever in trouble now so I was back to

square one feeling the pressure so now

you're probably thinking if it was going

to be this difficult this is what's

pressure why did I even accept today's

invitation in the first place well you

know my son goes here that's number one

that's a good reason and I always like

to check to see how my money is being

spent and I'm sure there's some parents

out there who can relate to what I'm

talking about yeah hmm everybody

upstairs and there were some other good

reasons for me to show up sure I got an

Academy Award but I never had something

called a magic meatball

after waiting in line for half an hour

at the pool truck yeah yes I talk face

to face with President Obama but I never

talked face to face with a guy named

tweeter who sings bad songs over it

smokes on Tuesday night I never been to

bouys I never been the demos yes I have

played a detective who battles demons

but I've never been to a school in my

life where the squirrel population has

gone bananas I mean they're breaking in

the dorm rooms they're walking around

campus I think I saw some carrying books

on their way to class

so I had to be here I had to come even

though I was afraid I might make a fool

of myself in fact if you really want to

know the truth

I had to come exactly because I had to

come exactly because I might make a fool

of myself now what am I talking about

here it is I found that nothing in life

is worthwhile unless you take risks

nothing Nelson Mandela said there is no

passion to be found playing small and

settling for a life that's less than the

one you're capable of living now I'm

sure in your experiences in school and

applying to college and picking your

major and deciding what you want to do

with life I'm sure people that told you

to make sure you have something to fall

back on make sure you got something to

fall back on honey but I never

understood that concept having something

to fall back on

if I'm going to fall I don't want to

fall back on anything except my faith I

want to fall forward I figure at least

this way I'll see what I'm going to hit

fall forward this is what I mean

Reggie Jackson struck out 26 hundred

times in his career the most in the

history of baseball but you don't hear

about the strikeouts people remember the

homeruns fall forward

thomas edison conducted 1,000 failed

experiments did you know that i didn't

know that because the 1,000 and first

was the light bulb fall forward every

failed experiment is one step closer to

success you've got to take risks and i'm

sure you probably heard that before but

i want to talk to you about why that's

important I got three reasons and then

you can pick up your iPhone's first you

will fail at some point in your life

accept it you will lose you will

embarrass yourself you will suck at

something there's no doubt about it and

I know that's probably not a traditional

message for a graduation ceremony today

I'm telling you embrace it

because it's inevitable and I should

know in the acting business you fail all

the time early on in my career I

auditioned for a part in a Broadway

musical perfect role for me I thought

except for the fact that I can't sing so

I'm in the wings I'm about to go onstage

but the guy in front of me he's singing

like like like Pavarotti he's just no

longer he's just going on and on and on

and I'm just shrinking I'm getting

smaller and smaller so they say oh thank

you very much thank you very much and

you will you'll be hearing from us so I

come out with my little sheet music and

it was it was a just my imagination by

the temptations that's what I came up

with so I hand it to the the accompanies

and she looks at it and looks at me and

excited the director

was like all right so I start you know

like I'm gonna sing I'm once again again

carrying away with me and they're not

saying anything so I'm thinking I'm

getting better I start to start getting

into it

running this out of you thank you thank

you thank you thank you very much mr.

Washington thank you so I assumed I

didn't get the job but the next part of

the audition he called me back the next

part of the audition is the acting part

of the audition so I'm like hey okay

maybe I can't sing but I know I can act

so they pair me with this guy and again

I didn't know about musical theater in

musical theater is big so they can reach

everyone all the way in the back of the

stadium and I'm more from a realistic

naturalistic kind of acting where you

you know you actually talk to the person

next to you so I don't know what my line

was my line was will hand me the cut and

his line was well I will hand you the

cup my dear the cup would be there to be

handed to you I said okay

well should I give you the cup back oh

yes you should give it back to me

because you know that is my cup and it

should be given back to me I didn't get

the job but here's the thing I didn't

quit I didn't fall back I walked out it

it to prepare for the next audition and

the next audition and the next audition

I prayed I prayed and I prayed

but I continue to fail and fail and fail

but it didn't matter because you know

what is an old saying you hang around

the barbershop long enough sooner or

later you're going to get a haircut so

you will catch a break and I did catch a

break last year I did a play called

fences on Broadway someone talked about

it won the Tony Award and I didn't have

to sing by the way but here's the kicker

he was at the Court Theatre he was at

the same theatre that I failed that

first audition 30 years prior the the

point is and I'll pick up the pace the

point is every graduate here today has

the training and the talent to succeed

but do you have the guts to fail here's

my second point about failure if you

don't fail you're not even trying

I'll say it again if you don't fail

you're not even trying my wife told me

this great expression to get something

you never had you have to do something

you never did Les Brown's a motivational

speaker you made an analogy about this

he says imagine you're on your deathbed

and standing around your deathbed are

the ghosts representing your unfulfilled

potential the ghost of the ideas you

never acted on the ghosts of the talents

you didn't use and they're standing

around your bed angry disappointed and

upset they say we came to you because

you could have brought us to life they

say and now we have to go to the grave

together so I ask you today how many

ghosts are going to be around your bed

when your time comes

you go west you've invested a lot in

your education and people have invested

in you and let me tell you the world

needs your talents and does it ever I

just got back from Africa like two days

ago so if I'm rambling on it's cuz I'm

jet lag I just got back from South

Africa it's a beautiful country but

there are places there with terrible

part of it poverty that need help in

Africa is just the tip of the iceberg

the Middle East needs your help

Japan needs your help Alabama needs your

help Tennessee needs your help

Louisiana needs your help Philadelphia

needs your help the world the world

needs a lot and we need it from you we

really do we need it from you young

people I mean I'm not speaking for the

rest of us up here but I know I'm

getting a little grayer we need it from

you the young people because remember

this so you got to get out there you got

to give it everything you got

whether it's your time your your your

talent your prayers or your treasures

because remember this you will never see

a u-haul behind a hearse

I'll say it again you will never see a

u-haul behind a hearse you can't take it

with you

the Egyptians tried it and all they got

was robbed so the question is what are

you going to do with what you have I'm

not talking about how much you have some

of you are business majors some of you

are theologians nurses sociologists some

of you have money some of you have

patients some of you have kindness some

of you have loved some of you have the

gift of long-suffering whatever it is

whatever your gift is what are you going

to do with what you have all right now

here's my last point about failure

sometimes it's the best way to figure

out where you're going your life will

never be a straight path I began at

Fordham University as a pre-med student

I took a course called the cardiac

morphus I still can't say it cardiac

cardiac morphogenesis I couldn't read it

I couldn't say it I sure couldn't pass

it so then I decided to go into pre-law

then journalism and with no academic

focus my grades took off in their own

direction

yeah down I was a 1.8 GPA one semester

and the University very politely

suggested that it might be better to

take some time off I was twenty years

old

I was at my lowest point and then one

day and I remember the exact day March

27 1975 I was helping my mother in her

beauty shop my mother owned the beauty

shop up in my Vernon and there's there

was this older woman who was considered

one of the elders in the town and I

didn't know her personally but I was

looking in the mirror and every time I

looked at the mirror I could see her

behind me and she was staring at me she

just kept looking at me every time I

looked at it she kept giving me these

strange looks so she finally took the

dryer off her head and sets the sump she

said something I'll never forget

first of all she said somebody give me a

piece of paper give me a piece of paper

she said young boy I have a prophecy a

spiritual prophecy she said you are

going to travel the world and speak to

millions of people now mind you I'm 20

years old I'm flunked out of school in

fact like a wiseass I'm thinking to

myself maybe she's got something in that

crystal ball about me getting back at

the school next fall but maybe she was

onto something because later that summer

while working as a counselor to YMCA

camp in Connecticut we put on a talent

show for the campers and after the show

another counselor came up to me and

asked have you ever thought about acting

you're good at that so when I got back

to Fordham that fall I got in and I

changed my major once again for the last

time and in the years that followed just

as that woman prophesized I have

traveled the world and I have spoken to

millions of people through my movies

millions who up till this day couldn't

see me up till this day I couldn't see

while I was talking to them and they

couldn't see me they could only see the

movie they couldn't see the real me

but I see you today

and I'm encouraged by what I see and I'm

strengthened by what I see and I love

what I see

one more page now shut up let me

conclude with this one final point

actually the president kind of brought

it up has to do with the movie

Philadelphia

she stole my material many years ago I

did this movie called Philadelphia we

filmed some of the scenes right here on

campus Philadelphia came out in 1993

most of you were probably still in

diapers some of the professors too but I

cracked me up but it was a good movie

ran it on what he called it Netflix it's

good movie renting I get 23 cents every

time you rent it please true parents up

their rent rent rented netflix please

tell your friends too it's about a man

played by Tom Hanks who's fired from his

law firm because he has AIDS he wants to

sue the firm but no one's willing to

represent him until the homophobic

ambulance chaser lawyer played by yours

truly takes on the case in a way if you

watched the movie you'll see everything

I'm talking about today you'll see what

I mean about taking risk or being

willing to fail because taking risk is

not just about going for a job it's also

about knowing what you know and what you

don't know it's about being open to

people and to ideas in the course of the

film the character I play begins to take

small steps small risks he's very very

very slowly begins to overcome his fears

and I feel ultimately his heart becomes

flooded with love and I can't think of a

better message as we send you off today

to not only take risks but to be open to

life to accept new views and to be open

to new opinions to be willing to speak

at a commencement at one of the best

country vesica universities in the

country even though you're scared stiff

while it may be frightening it will also

be rewarding because the chances you

take the people you meet the people you

love the faith that you have that's

what's going to define you so members of

the class of 2011 this is your mission

when you leave the friendly confines of

Philly never be discouraged never hold

back give everything you got and when

you fall throughout life and maybe even

tonight after a few many glasses of

champagne

remember this fall forward

congratulations I love you god bless you

I respect you

you

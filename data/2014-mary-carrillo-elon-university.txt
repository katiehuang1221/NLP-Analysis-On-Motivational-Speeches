I would like to thank you all for the

high honor of direct addressing you this

morning and not unlike last year's

speaker my friend Brian Williams of NBC

News I have to start with the confession

that I never graduated from college not

to put too fine a point on it but I

didn't even attend one and at the risk

of overstating this situation my high

school attendance record was very spotty

I never thought of myself as a student

honestly I was a jock unencumbered by

the onus of achieving greatness as some

sort of academic but I'm speaking to you

today as a parent more than anything

else I'm here today because of my

daughter Rachel who is shortly having an

emotional time of it today she has loved

Elon it's been her world for a good

while now and yours too you're likely

remembering the first time you said

hello to a lot of people who knit you

now count as your closest friends and

you will surely remember telling them

goodbye today it's your brains in your

talent that brought you together and you

would take all of that and more with you

to the next place to a life full of

adventure and though it won't all be

great from here the world doesn't work

that way a lot of it will be great a lot

of it will as a parent I can tell you

with some certainty that there's at

least one student among you that's just

a little jumpy about what comes next I

get that I do but to any of you who

might be feeling that way may I say

there's a whole bunch of us watching you

graduate today who would trade places

with you in a heartbeat to get up from

those chairs that all the parents are

sitting in and being you're young and

are young 20s again with our whole lines

a vast incredible stretch of open road

ahead of us my world in my twenties is

all about trying to play professional

tennis but my knees were bed and frankly

so is my serve and by 23 I was washed up

unemployed so I needed another dream and

while I was figuring out what I should

be what I should be I was teaching

tennis and doing some writing and I

started to get some tea

- and my love of tennis morphed into a

love of all sports and the stories they

tell and I've been telling stories ever

since I'm lucky enough and maybe dumb

enough to not be Tareq to not have been

terribly worried about when I what I was

going to be when I was 23 years old but

if you have an open mind you can push in

any direction you want so that's pretty

much what I did I had some passion and

some purpose and as I've always told my

kids if you do it lucky you love and

love what you do if you really dig what

you're doing it makes things looser and

lighter and very enjoyable - so my first

bit of advice to you today would be this

get into something and see where it

takes you and if you really seem to like

it get good at it there is nothing like

confidence your bosses will recognize

and appreciate that quality immediately

about my first job about your first job

don't treat it like that everything

counts I've been telling this to my kids

forever everything counts my first job

was straight out of high school teaching

tennis and working nights in a Pro Shop

for 50 bucks a week that went on for a

year and a half in the hot Florida Sun

and I had to share an apartment with

three other women and you know what it

was terrific and if you want to find out

quickly just how well you know something

try to teach it am i right I learned a

lot about my sport by having to explain

it to other people and I learned a lot

about myself and I met a terrific guy

and I was married who I was married to

for 15 years and one of our kids is

sitting here about to graduate from Elon

that all came out of my first job and

while I'm happy to report that my salary

is exponentially higher than it was when

I was 18 years old

I'm not exponentially happier than I was

when I was 18 I wasn't poor back then I

just didn't have any money and I truly

enjoyed where I was and who I was with

and what I was doing and all the stuff

that I imagined was

head of me all of which is to say

whatever you do when you leave Elon

treated like it's the most important job

you'll ever have

my first job shaped my whole life so

enjoy the experience you may meet

someone who can change your life and

give a good handshake by the way you

never know whose hand is on the other

side of yours build your reputation and

your work ethic and your good name

there is a distinct thrill to committing

to something to be all in to becoming

the kind of person you admire most and

with that in mind a quick tip about the

workplace your love life and the perils

of social media if you've got to think

about it you probably shouldn't do it

I'm especially thinking about yeah right

I know um I'm especially thinking about

Facebook post or angry angry emails or

drunken tweets but pretend you're

sending those things directly to your

Aunt Edna who has no sense of humor and

though this may seem like a

contradiction of that last bit of advice

bet on yourself take some risks just out

of your comfort zone risks challenge

yourself often enough to really feel

alive sometimes you just need to hold

your nose and jump into something early

on in my TV life I was asked to cover

other sports and although I had no real

business saying yes to covering downhill

ski racing for instance I said yes

mostly because the job would be taking

me to court Enid um peso and kids fuel

and Sun Valley and chemin II I mean I'm

not an idiot but my overriding attitude

was if I can't pull this off I'll get

canned but I think I can pull this off

and I said yes then and I still say yes

whenever something sounds like it Turkey

can turn out to be something special

I've been to the last 12 Olympics those

events have taken me to a 15th century

monastery in China above the clouds I've

never seen anything like that I played

with panda bears in Chengdu and studied

polar bears near the North Pole I've

held some of the oldest man-made tools

in the world in my hands I spent two

weeks in Siberia two weeks in December

in Siberia

I've bog snorkels in Wales another bit

of advice don't go Bach snorkeling if

someone says to you do you want to go to

Wales and go bog snorkeling say no but I

do understand the Olympic spirit because

I think I've got it other jobs have

taken me to far-off places last year I

needed a bodyguard so I could tell a

story in Pakistan I needed a lot of

vaccinations to tell a story in Kenya I

travelled with the homeless New York

soccer team to the homeless World Cup in

Graz Austria and next summer in

preparation for the Summer Olympics in

Rio

2016 I'll take to the Amazon not the

website the original there are plenty of

people who know more about the Amazon

than I do but I'm very curious and I'm

very game and when they asked me if I

wanted to travel down the Amazon next

summer I said hell yes as much as you

can in your life say yes you'll have

more regrets about things you didn't do

than things you did do so bet on

yourself which brings me back to sports

I've had chances three years to move

totally away from sports and into news

and I've resisted and some people wonder

why I like athletes so much I love and

admire the athletic heart I respect

commitment and resilience and patience

and passion and purpose I judge people

by how many times they get up off the

mat after they've been knocked down and

I am constantly amazed by how often and

how well athletes can reset it's one of

the best qualities to have the ability

to reset after you've taken a hard hit I

have had the pleasure and privilege of

seeing the human spirit in full flight

so many times in so many ways I've seen

incredible sporting upsets that lift an

entire nation into paroxysms of joy I've

seen athletes compete with broken legs

and broken hearts and still find a way

to triumph I've seen defeats handled

with so much dignity it's made me cry so

many of the best stories and sports are

the ones you find in the locker rooms of

those who've just lost

teams of men and women who comfort one

another as they themselves weep I love

the athletic hard so I've hung around

sports because it's given me the chance

to not only see those luminous moments

of humanity play out but also see so

much of this magnificent world of ours I

love to travel across this planet and my

poor kid rachel has heard me say this so

times but I believe it with all my heart

we live on the greatest planet ever I

know that sounds very parochial of me

there are countless nameless unknown

solar systems and billions of stars and

Suns and moons and black holes on I know

that but have you taken a good look

around planet Earth astronomers get

excited when they discover signs of

water on Mars we've got oceans with

beluga whales in them we've got lagoons

we've got forest with sequoias we've got

aardvarks baby ducks volcanoes and

mountain ranges and raging rivers and

desolate deserts

we've got cocker spaniels it's big wet

eyes there may be all manner of life and

intelligence and advanced thinking on

millions of other planets I know that

but do you think those planets have

cocker spaniels I say no and I'm going

to ask all of you to be better guardians

of this planet than we have before you

from the time I was a very small child

my dad would implore me to be mindful of

our world and its fragile ecosystem no

one has ever walked this earth lighter

and gentler than my dad

Rachel's grandfather I hope to see in

chairs as much of this planet as I can

before I'm all said and done with this

life and even if you don't like to

travel you can appreciate it and respect

what we have and what it all means to

everyone and everything that lives here

a lot of you have been good students

you're good solid people and good

Americans go one step further

be good Earthlings and protect and heal

this fine planet of ours and just so you

don't think I'm asking you to mop up

after all of us who have come before you

let me say one final thing I'm not

asking you kids to change the whole

world

but if you're kind you're doing far more

than you know

there's nothing more powerful than

kindness if you're kind to people you

change one life because of how you treat

someone and if that person in turn is

kind of someone else that's how this

great spinning world of ours really

changes one Jeff's your one conversation

one small shiny the little moment of

time Rachel I still don't know where you

are

she never listens actually she does like

so many other parents here feel about

their kid let me say that I adore you

and your dad and all the rest of our

family are very proud of you those who

are here and those who wish they were

you know the kind of person we hoped

you'd be

you have changed our lives in so many

meaningful ways

keep changing our lives keep changing

other lives I hope that all of you

graduating from Elon today just keep

doing that congratulations to you all
